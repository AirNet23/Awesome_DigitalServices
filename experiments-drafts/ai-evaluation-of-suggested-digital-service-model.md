# AI Evaluation of suggested digital service model

<mark style="color:blue;">**Q:**</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">The following is a model of our information society:</mark>

_<mark style="color:blue;">The societies of today using digital services. A digital service is realizing multiple functions. A function takes an amount of time to transform a state into another distinct state. The states having different complexity and there is different amount of changes to be done to reach them. The transformation is driven by one or more causes. Typical or reoccurring causes are called „laws“. A function is an inherent part of a working system (digital service).</mark>_

_<mark style="color:blue;">A functions amount of time and amount of changes are dependent to the properties of communication technology used in this system.</mark>_

_<mark style="color:blue;">A functions causes are dependent to properties of human needs (one human), properties of human relationship interactions (two humans), properties of human group interactions and properties of our society system (Capitalism). The last four represent different complexity levels of human action driven causes. They are divided because on each level synergies and emergent effects are occurring that can not be explained from the single human actions.</mark>_

_<mark style="color:blue;">A functions causes are also dependent to the synergies and emergent effects that are formed by the described properties.</mark>_

_<mark style="color:blue;">Function exists also themselves the don't need to be integrated into a digital service. For example long distance communicating was also possible with letters and driven by the properties of human needs: need for information and relationships as causes.</mark>_

_<mark style="color:blue;">To say it in other words: Digital services integrate this functions by modify them by changing their amount of time and amount of changes, or some of the causes and or extend them. To the modification also counts „rechanneling“ of communication because it changes amount of time and amount of changes. Also some society functions could be discarded by digital services or newly created, if the service depends on at least one other independent society processes.</mark>_

_<mark style="color:blue;">To integrate in our society digital services where bootstrapped a specific time. At this moment society was in a specific economic, social, legal, mental, physical, political, communicative state. These states lead to different challenges on scaling.</mark>_

_<mark style="color:blue;">The combination of functions and historical scaling challenges driven the development of a business model.</mark>_

_<mark style="color:blue;">Since the digital services create discard or alter society functions their functions have a feedback on the individum, the relationship, the group and the society system and alter their properties. On the other direction companies of digital services using the engagement of the individual, the relationsship, the group and the society system in their digital services to alter the functions of the service to their needs. (Often optimizing them for revenue.)</mark>_

_<mark style="color:blue;">If we let the digital service unaltered we can extrapolate trends to the specific economic, social, legal, mental, physical, political, communicative state of our society.</mark>_



<mark style="color:blue;">I</mark>_<mark style="color:blue;">f we set a general scheme on what is good for society like this:</mark>_

_<mark style="color:blue;">- High individuality of thoughts between individual humans</mark>_

_<mark style="color:blue;">- High amount of effective communication and sharing of thoughts between humans</mark>_

_<mark style="color:blue;">- Adaptive Independence of individual humans: Thoughts shouldn't be restricted, Actions should be restricted if they tackle the morals of live and self independence up to community level.</mark>_

_<mark style="color:blue;">- High sustainability of humans society and actions.</mark>_

_<mark style="color:blue;">We can define malfunctions (flaws) that are working against this goals in society by looking at the result state of the functions and their involved properties an, synergies and emergent effects. Some flaws are still inherited by the original society functions. Some are caused by the newly crafted digital functions and we are able to attribut them to our digital functions partly.</mark>_

_<mark style="color:blue;">To reduce the effect of this malfunctions there the company of the digital service has taken measures in the past. Also third parties have taken measure. Lawmakers have taken regulatory efforts and Researches have taken Research efforts. There is a set of flaws that couldn't be restricted or solved by these kind of efforts. We could also identify the by examining how the described efforts changes the single functions.</mark>_

<mark style="color:blue;">Evaluate the logical coherency of this model. Evaluate how good the model is to structural analyze all of our big digital services (instagram, facebook, whatsapp etc). Evaluate how good this model is an guideline to design an on social media. Rewrite the model if you see some errors and add details if needed.</mark>



<mark style="color:blue;">**A:**</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">The model presented provides a comprehensive overview of the various components and factors involved in the functioning and development of digital services in today's information society. It acknowledges the role of communication technology, human needs, human relationships, and societal systems in shaping these digital services. The model also takes into account the historical context and challenges faced by digital services as they scale and evolve.</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">The logical coherence of this model is strong, as it effectively demonstrates the interdependence and feedback loops between digital services, human needs, relationships, and societal systems. It also recognizes the potential for synergies and emergent effects at different levels of complexity, which can impact the development and functioning of digital services.</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">The model is well-suited for structurally analyzing major digital services like Instagram, Facebook, and WhatsApp, as it considers the various factors that drive their growth and evolution. By examining the functions and properties of these services, as well as their impact on individuals, relationships, and society, the model provides a solid foundation for understanding their role in our information society.</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">As a guideline for designing social media platforms, this model offers a valuable framework for evaluating the potential impact of a new service on individuals and society. By identifying and addressing potential malfunctions or flaws that may work against the defined goals of high individuality, effective communication, adaptive independence, and sustainability, designers can create more responsible and beneficial social platforms.</mark>



<mark style="color:blue;">**There are a few minor adjustments and additions that could be made to improve the model:**</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">1. The model could benefit from further</mark> <mark style="color:blue;"></mark><mark style="color:blue;">**elaboration on the role of emerging technologies,**</mark> <mark style="color:blue;"></mark><mark style="color:blue;">such as artificial intelligence and machine learning, in shaping digital services and their functions.</mark>

The model could explore the</mark> <mark style="color:blue;"></mark><mark style="color:blue;">**impact of globalization and cultural differences on the development and use of digital services**</mark><mark style="color:blue;">, as these factors can significantly influence user behavior and societal norms.</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">3. The model could also consider the</mark> <mark style="color:blue;"></mark><mark style="color:blue;">**ethical implications of digital services, particularly in terms of data privacy and security**</mark><mark style="color:blue;">, as these issues are increasingly important in the context of modern information society.</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">Overall, the presented model is a strong foundation for understanding the complexities of digital services in our information society and offers valuable insights for analyzing existing platforms and designing new social media services.</mark>



The LLM should continue by adapting the theory with these aspects.\


<mark style="color:blue;">**Q:**</mark> <mark style="color:blue;"></mark><mark style="color:blue;">Please integrate your recommendations into the model by adding the needed sentences</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">**A:**</mark> _<mark style="color:blue;">The societies of today use digital services, which are continuously evolving due to multiple factors such as communication technology, human needs, human relationships, and societal systems like capitalism. These digital services are realized through various functions that transform states based on time, complexity, and changes required. The transformation is driven by causes related to human needs, relationships, group interactions, and societal systems, with synergies and emergent effects occurring at different complexity levels.</mark>_\


_<mark style="color:blue;">A function's properties are influenced by communication technology, human needs, relationships, and group interactions. Emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence and machine learning, also play an essential role in shaping these digital services and their functions. Furthermore, globalization and cultural differences impact the development and use of digital services, as they significantly influence user behavior and societal norms.</mark>_

_<mark style="color:blue;">**The ethical implications of digital services, particularly in terms of data privacy and security, should be considered as they are increasingly crucial in our modern information society. To integrate**</mark> <mark style="color:blue;"></mark><mark style="color:blue;">these digital services into our society, they were bootstrapped at a specific time when society was in a particular economic, social, legal, mental, physical, political, and communicative state. These states led to different challenges in scaling and developing business models.</mark>_\


_<mark style="color:blue;">Digital services create, alter, or discard societal functions, which feed back into the individual, the relationship, the group, and the societal system. Companies operating these digital services leverage the engagement of individuals, relationships, groups, and societal systems to adapt these functions to their needs, often optimizing them for revenue generation.</mark>_

_<mark style="color:blue;">By setting a general scheme of what is good for society – high individuality of thoughts, effective communication, adaptive independence, and sustainability – we can identify malfunctions or flaws in society by looking at the result state of the functions and their involved properties, synergies, and emergent effects. Some flaws are inherent in the original societal functions, while others are caused by newly crafted digital functions.</mark>_

_<mark style="color:blue;">To reduce the impact of these malfunctions, companies, third parties, lawmakers, and researchers have taken various measures in the past. However, some flaws could not be addressed or solved by these efforts. By examining how these efforts change the individual functions, we can identify the remaining challenges.</mark>_

<mark style="color:blue;">This improved model provides a comprehensive and coherent understanding of digital services in our information society. It is well-suited for analyzing existing platforms like Instagram, Facebook, and WhatsApp and serves as a valuable guideline for designing new social media services that prioritize individuality, effective communication, adaptive independence, and sustainability.</mark>

I advised the LLM to prepare a structured document for that model. I will do the same step with a later model based on the research results.

<mark style="color:blue;">**Q:**</mark> <mark style="color:blue;"></mark><mark style="color:blue;">Okay now create a well structured taxonomy for applying this model. The taxonomy could contain several layers of subpoints if needed. The Taxonomy should have two use cases on the one side it should be the taxonomy for a catalogue that lists the different properties, synergias, flaws etc and on the other side also a scheme for the analysis of the services. New thoughts created by the anaylzis on each subpoint should be added without any problems to the catalogue. Please give a short introduction text what the content of each point and subpoint is.</mark>
