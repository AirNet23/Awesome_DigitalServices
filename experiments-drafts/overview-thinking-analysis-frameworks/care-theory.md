# CARE Theory

I tried to get a better suggestions of theories and frameworks by specifing my design goals in a prompt.

<mark style="color:blue;">**Q:**</mark> <mark style="color:blue;"></mark><mark style="color:blue;">My goal is the design of several social media processes that improve the social relationships between humans by using a more natural way how humans build there relations and providing the advantages of internet information exchange (e.g. any location, instant, huge amount of memory, decentralization in packet switching networks... ) into human relationships. The design process should understand current social media systems. Identitfy the interplay of processes that leads to well documented flaws (e.g. social saturation, fake news, hatepeech, amplification of polarizing opinions, loss of privacy) and in a further analysis identify leverage points. Please update your recommondations of thinking frameworks.</mark>

\
<mark style="color:blue;">Considering your specific goal of designing social media processes that improve social relationships, while addressing the well-documented flaws, I recommend combining elements of the following frameworks:</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">**1. Socio-Technical Systems (STS) Framework:**</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">Use STS to understand the interplay between social and technical aspects of current social media systems, and how they contribute to the flaws you've mentioned. This will help you identify social and technical components that need improvement.</mark>



<mark style="color:blue;">**2. Human-Centered Design (HCD):**</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">HCD is a design methodology that focuses on understanding the needs, preferences, and behaviors of users to create solutions that are tailored to their experience. Apply HCD principles to design social media processes that align with natural human behaviors and relationships.</mark>



<mark style="color:blue;">**3. Complex Adaptive Systems (CAS) Theory:**</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">Use CAS to analyze the emergent properties and dynamics of current social media systems, and to identify leverage points for intervention. This will help you understand the potential impact of your proposed solutions on the broader social media ecosystem.</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">By combining elements of these frameworks, you can create a comprehensive and nuanced understanding of the social media landscape, and design processes that address both the social and technical components involved. This approach will allow you to address the well-documented flaws while harnessing the advantages of internet information exchange in human relationships.</mark>



After that I decided to let the AI interconnect some of the suggested frameworks and added technica poroperties of the internet.

<mark style="color:blue;">**Q:**</mark> <mark style="color:blue;"></mark><mark style="color:blue;">Which elements of Shuboffs theory, Luhmanns system theory, theory of techno social systems and actor network theory can be combined to create a new theoretical framework that can explain the rise, the driving factors of social media Attribute Theorie effects of society to their processes or the interplay of their processes with other social system pocesses and ultimately contribute to the goal of designing a new social media that strengthens and deepens human relationships by being Designers more near to human thinking and providing technological advantages of the Internet. (real time, any location, mass memory, automatic focus with algorithmus, new content forms ?</mark>&#x20;

<mark style="color:blue;">Give the new framework a name and name the concepts and from which theory you have taken them from.</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">**A:**</mark> <mark style="color:blue;"></mark><mark style="color:blue;">The</mark> <mark style="color:blue;"></mark><mark style="color:blue;">**"Human-Centric Techno-Social Network Theory"**</mark>  <mark style="color:blue;"><mark style="color:red;">**\[comment: Later CARE theory]**<mark style="color:red;"></mark> <mark style="color:blue;"></mark><mark style="color:blue;">can be a new theoretical framework that combines elements from Z</mark><mark style="color:blue;">**uboff's Surveillance Capitalism, Luhmann's System Theory, Techno-Social Systems Theory, and Actor-Network Theory**</mark> <mark style="color:blue;"></mark><mark style="color:blue;">to explain the rise and driving factors of social media, their effects on society, and the design of new social media platforms that strengthen and deepen human relationships.</mark>&#x20;

<mark style="color:blue;">The key components of this new framework can include:</mark>&#x20;

<mark style="color:blue;">**1. Surveillance Capitalism (Zuboff):**</mark> <mark style="color:blue;"></mark><mark style="color:blue;">Acknowledge the role of data extraction and behavioral prediction in shaping social media platforms, focusing on how to mitigate these aspects in a human-centric social media design.</mark>&#x20;

<mark style="color:blue;">**2. Social Systems (Luhmann):**</mark> <mark style="color:blue;"></mark><mark style="color:blue;">Incorporate the idea that social media platforms are part of a larger social system, where they interact with other systems and are shaped by their communication processes. This perspective can help identify and address the intersections of social media with other social systems, such as politics, economics, and culture.</mark>&#x20;

<mark style="color:blue;">**3. Techno-Social Systems Theory:**</mark> <mark style="color:blue;"></mark><mark style="color:blue;">Emphasize the co-evolution of technology and society, recognizing that social media platforms are not just technological artifacts, but also part of complex social processes. This understanding can guide the design of social media platforms that are better aligned with human values and needs.</mark>&#x20;

<mark style="color:blue;">**4. Actor-Network Theory:**</mark> <mark style="color:blue;"></mark><mark style="color:blue;">Consider social media platforms as networks of human and non-human actors (e.g., users, algorithms, devices), with an emphasis on the relationships and interactions among these actors. This approach can help identify points of intervention to foster more meaningful and supportive connections between users.</mark>&#x20;



Now the AI should specify how I can write down analysis results using this theory. It gave a more general answer..

<mark style="color:blue;">**Q:**</mark> <mark style="color:blue;"></mark><mark style="color:blue;">\[not documented while researching]</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">**A:**</mark> <mark style="color:blue;"></mark><mark style="color:blue;">To</mark> <mark style="color:blue;"></mark><mark style="color:blue;">**operationalize the Human-Centric Techno-Social Network Theory**</mark><mark style="color:blue;">, the following concepts can be integrated from the respective theories:</mark>&#x20;

<mark style="color:blue;">**1. From Zuboff's Surveillance Capitalism**</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">- Data sovereignty: Empowering users with control over their data, including how it is collected, used, and shared.</mark>&#x20;

<mark style="color:blue;">- Privacy by design: Integrating privacy and data protection measures from the earliest stages of social media platform development.</mark>&#x20;

<mark style="color:blue;">**2. From Luhmann's System Theory**</mark>&#x20;

<mark style="color:blue;">- Communication and meaning: Fostering meaningful communication between users and ensuring the relevance of content shared on social media platforms.</mark>&#x20;

<mark style="color:blue;">- Autopoiesis: Encouraging the self-organization and self-regulation of social media communities, emphasizing user-driven content and interaction.</mark>&#x20;

<mark style="color:blue;">**3. From Techno-Social Systems Theory**</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">- Co-evolution: Designing social media platforms that evolve alongside human needs and values, ensuring their continued relevance and usefulness.</mark>&#x20;

<mark style="color:blue;">- Socio-technical affordances: Offering features and functionalities that support positive social interactions and deeper connections between users.</mark>&#x20;

<mark style="color:blue;">**4. From Actor-Network Theory**</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">- Network formation: Encouraging the formation of supportive and diverse networks of human and non-human actors on social media platforms.</mark>&#x20;

<mark style="color:blue;">- Mediation and translation: Ensuring that algorithms, interfaces, and other non-human actors on social media platforms facilitate meaningful connections and interactions between users.</mark>&#x20;

<mark style="color:blue;">By combining these elements, the Human-Centric Techno-Social Network Theory can provide a comprehensive framework for understanding and designing social media platforms that prioritize human relationships, values, and needs, while harnessing the technological advantages of the internet to create more meaningful and supportive online experiences.</mark>



I asked the AI for a more catchy name for the theory. It should be better remembered by readers for popularity reasons.

<mark style="color:blue;">**Q:**</mark> <mark style="color:blue;"></mark><mark style="color:blue;">Change the theory name to a catchy Name so that the start letters of the words of the theory name form a word themselve.</mark>
