<mark style="color:blue;">**Q:**</mark> <mark style="color:blue;"></mark><mark style="color:blue;">I need a framework for system thinking. I want to document how social media systems integrate into society by working out the interrelationsships to properties and existing processes of the individual human,groups and different areas of society. After identifiying basics processes and properties I can group them together to describe some processes that drive social media acceptance or describe how social medias technical possibilities extend or nihiliate already consisting social processes. On a second level I want to describe how these changes or newly created proceesses affected different levels (individums, groups, society). At this description I get a feedback loop since newly or altered social processes interact again with already consisting processes or further social media processes leading to new effects. This cycle can be repeated at an infinite recursion level. I need a thinking framework to out formulate my results in an understandable and structured why. Please recommend a suitable thinking framework.</mark>
