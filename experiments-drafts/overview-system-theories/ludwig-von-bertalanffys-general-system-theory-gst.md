# Ludwig von Bertalanffy's General System Theory (GST)

<mark style="color:blue;">**A:**</mark> <mark style="color:blue;"></mark><mark style="color:blue;">Ludwig von Bertalanffy, an Austrian biologist, developed the General System Theory in the 1930s-1960s. The primary context of his work was to address the limitations of the reductionist approach in understanding complex biological systems. Bertalanffy believed that a holistic approach was needed to study these systems. The GST aimed to provide a unifying framework across different scientific disciplines, including biology, psychology, sociology, and engineering.</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">**Similarities:**</mark> <mark style="color:blue;"></mark><mark style="color:blue;">Like other system theories, the GST emphasizes the importance of understanding the interdependencies and relationships between components within a system. It also shares the idea of systems being self-regulating and having feedback loops.</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">**Differences:**</mark> <mark style="color:blue;"></mark><mark style="color:blue;">The GST is more focused on providing a general framework for understanding systems across various disciplines, rather than focusing on specific systems like Luhmann's system theory, which focuses primarily on social systems.</mark>
