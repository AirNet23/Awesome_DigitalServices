# Online radicalisation loop: Theories of "Breaking the social media prism"

Q: There should be theoretically and extended version of this effect. People search on social media when they search for entertainment (boredom) or validation (struggle with themselves) but how does it fit that the opions on platforms like twitter are the most extrem than. Under the assumption people there should be under a constant threat of her identity but still the logging in ?

A: The details you are referring to are connected to human psychology and the design of social media platforms:

1. In-Group Validation: Typically, humans tend to seek validation from their in-group, the people who share similar values, beliefs, and behaviors. Social media, with its community structures and echo chambers, provides an easy platform for this, where opinions get reinforced instead of challenged.
2. Intensity of Engagement: Social media platforms are designed to promote content that generates engagement, and often, extreme opinions provoke strong reactions and therefore more engagement. Controversial or polarizing content can spark heated debates, making them more likely to be promoted by the platform's algorithm.
3. Social Status and Identity Performance: Bail suggests that users usually construct somewhat radical identities online due to perceived threats to their status. Extreme opinions gain more attention, and hence, individuals might use this approach to gain recognition, defend their social status, or get validation. This encourages a cycle of more extreme stances being adopted and portrayed online.
4. Desensitization: Continuous exposure to divisive content may desensitize users to extreme views over time, leading to a normalization of such opinions. In other words, constant confrontation with radical content may gradually push someone's tolerance threshold, hence 'normalizing' extremist viewpoints.
5. Escapism: Those who log into social media platforms for entertainment might unknowingly get drawn into the polarized world due to algorithms. For example, an algorithm might suggest a controversial video to a user because it's popular, and, out of curiosity or boredom, the user may watch it, thus exposing them to radical viewpoints.
6. Confirmation Bias: People also use social media to seek information that confirms their existing beliefs. Even if they encounter threatening ideas, they have a tendency to interpret or selectively recall information in a way that confirms their preexisting beliefs, ideas, or values.

These factors, combined with the 'feedback loop of radicalization' mentioned in the book, help explain why individuals consistently log into social media platforms even when they may be exposed to potentially threatening, opposite viewpoints.



Q: I want to add another puzzle part: Are there any studies that shows that positive dopamin resulting effects will be remembered far better than hurting or uncomfortable feelings ? When seeing social media as a two sided coin you will subconsciously grave for the validation while taking the risk for identity threat. In the end even if discussion is heated and you feel uncomfortable the brain will maybe focus only on positive emotional signals from your group and you wont stop usign this platforms.



A: Yes, what you're referring to is known as the "dopamine effect," which is linked to our reward response system. Dopamine is frequently described as playing a big role in reward-motivated behavior. Most types of rewards increase the level of dopamine in the brain. When we experience something rewarding or use an addictive substance, dopamine is released into different regions of our brain which creates a pleasant and happy feeling.

In relation to social media, the dopamine-driven feedback loops could be likened to a slot machine or lottery system, where the most appealing reward (validation, likes, shares, positive comments) are sporadic but highly rewarding. It has been proven that social media addiction correlates with the dopamine-induced reward system.

Your point suggesting that positive memories (linked with dopamine release) have a stronger impact on memory recall than negative experiences is partially accurate. It's known as the "pleasure principle," our instinctive drive to seek pleasure and avoid pain. However, the brain also tends to retain negative memories more durably as a survival mechanism - this is called negativity bias. Hence, depending on the individual, both positive and negative experiences can dominate memory recall.

Finally, let's note that while dopamine plays a significant role, the relationship between social media use, memory, and dopamine is complex and influenced by multiple factors including individual personality traits, the nature of the experience, and the context in which it happens.

In conclusion, there is a likelihood that rewarding experiences on social media that trigger dopamine releases could encourage users to keep using these platforms despite occasional negative experiences. Nonetheless, more research is needed in this area, as most conclusions are drawn from a combination of studies about internet addiction, memory, and neurobiology, not necessarily from studies directly examining the memory effect of dopamine release triggered by social media experiences.



Q: okay improve my theory that is built on "the feedback loop of radicalization" from "Breaking the social media prism" by using the knowledge about the reward response system, the polarized memorization of positive and negative emotions and the other hints you gave.

A:&#x20;

Based on the information provided, we can refine your theory as follows:

"The Extremism and Reinforcement Loop in Social Media is driven by a complex interplay of psychological needs, cognitive biases, social identity performance^1 and neurobiology^2.

1. Users log into social media seeking entertainment and validation. The platforms, with their algorithms and community structures, offer a sense of belonging and validation, particularly to those falling within a specific in-group^3 (a group sharing similar beliefs and values).
2. These platforms are designed to promote the content that generates the most engagement^4. Hence, extreme opinions that provoke strong reactions get more visibility, sparking debates and creating a cycle of increasingly polarized opinions for the sake of engagement.
3. When users express extreme opinions, they gain attention^3,5, boosting their social status within their in-group and allowing them to 'perform' an identity that gains recognition among like-minded individuals.
4. The brain's reward system (dopamine effect^2) comes into play here as the positive feedback (likes, comments, shares), and validation act as small 'rewards', further reinforcing the user's behavior. These 'rewarded' experiences are remembered better, leading to a cycle where users seek out these dopamine-boosting experiences^6.
5. Users may also have a confirmation bias^7 and preferentially recall information that aligns with their pre-existing beliefs, further skewing their perception and decisions^7.
6. Paradoxically, as users are drawn into more echo-chamber-like communities to seek validation, they might experience more threats to their social status from outsiders^5 or diverse-opinion holders, driving them further into the loop.

In conclusion, social media structures tend to amplify polarization and extremism due to a blend of design, human psychology, and neurobiology."

Q: please take also in regard the effect of memory recall, so that mostly strong negative and positive experiences of the platform got remembered. Especially when interatcion with other users.

A: Sure! Here is your refined theory incorporating memory recall:

"The Extremism and Reinforcement Loop in Social Media is fueled by sociopsychological needs, cognitive biases, social identity performance, neurobiology and selective memory recall.

1. Users log onto social media for entertainment and validation, with these platforms providing a sense of belonging and validation largely to those within a particular in-group sharing similar beliefs and values.
2. These platforms are designed to boost content that triggers the most engagement. Consequently, extreme viewpoints that provoke strong reactions gain more visibility, sparking debates and creating a cycle of categorically polarized views for enhanced engagement.
3. When users express extreme viewpoints, they also gain attention, boosting their perceived social status within their in-group and enabling them to 'perform' an identity that gains recognition among like-minded individuals.
4. The brain's reward system, specifically dopamine release, is integral in this process. Positive feedback, validation, and acknowledgement act as rewards that stimulate the release of dopamine, reinforcing the user's behavior.
5. The dopamine-induced rewards drive selective memory recall. The brain tends to remember strong positive experiences (due to the pleasure principle), and these rewarding experiences on social media platforms are thus more readily remembered and reinforced over time, leading to a cycle where users repeatedly seek out these dopamine-boosting experiences.
6. However, the brain also has a negativity bias and tends to retain negative memories for longer periods as a defense mechanism. The users might remember insults, trolling, or negative feedback that threatens their social status, pushing them to further assert their beliefs and inculcate themselves deeper into their in-groups.
7. Users commonly have a confirmation bias, where they tend to interpret or selectively recall information that aligns with their pre-existing beliefs. This further polarizes their outlook and behavioral response.
8. Paradoxically, as users get drawn deeper into the echo-chamber-like environment in pursuit of validation, they might face more threats to their social status from individuals who hold diverse opinions, which further entrenched them within the loop.

In conclusion, the social media space amplifies polarization and extremism due to a blend of its unique structure, human psychology, neurobiology, and cognitive biases, such as selective memory recall of strong positive and negative experiences."

Adding memory recall reveals a more nuanced connection between social media usage, polarization, neurobiology, and cognitive psychology. When pre-existing biases, dopamine-induced rewards, and selective memory recall interplay, they create a cyclic pattern encouraging users to stick to their stances, helping further radicalize their beliefs and actions.
