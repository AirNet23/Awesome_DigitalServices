Hi,

I am a student of society and computer science and want to create tools for our society that are more people serving than they we have currently to communicate, build relationships and define democratic consens.

I believe for that we didnt find any powerful enough thinking frameworks to understand, why we head to this situation with digital monopolists and gatekeepers controling information society. I strongly oppose the current state of society since the current system dont serve the people and is a mutated form of the original idea of the WWW with flourishing information diversity and enabeling peoples individual power to create and share.

HINT & HOW TO CONTRIBUTE: Because I uploaded in hurry all the color formating is gone... I will improve this soon. Also the next TODOs are to complete the german -> english translation, do a grammar check and complete chapter 2, by summarizing multiple sources at each subchapter.
