Hi,

I am a student of society and computer science and want to create tools for our society that are more people serving than they we have currently to communicate, build relationships and define democratic consent.

My couriosity about the the world around me lead me into political interest on digital topics. Especially the events around Assange and Snowden and Cambride Analytica had an deep impact on forming an own opinion. It lead me to more insightful reading of articles e.g netzpolitk.org,  books and varoius insightful conversation with professors and friends.

While a technology can be used for good and bad, the inherit  properties of this technology will enable the realization of different political ideas in an asymmetric way.&#x20;

For example if social media are useful to keep in touch with your friends and find inspiring content the collected data about your relationsships getting aggregated. Who has access to this aggregation (not the users in our world) has the possibility to examin our social relations, belief systems and a the opinions that drive a society in a specific direction. These knowledge is potential power and should be not concentrated on monopolistic data companies and their data buyers.&#x20;



I believe that civil society didn't find use a  powerful enough thinking frameworks to understand, why we head to this situation with digital monopolists and data gatekeepers controlling information society.&#x20;

I strongly oppose the current state of society since the current system don#t serve the people and is a mutated form of the original idea of the WWW with flourishing information diversity and enabling peoples individual power to create and share and extend there knowledge there.
