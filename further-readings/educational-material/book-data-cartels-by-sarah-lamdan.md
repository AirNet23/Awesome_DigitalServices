Write a short paragraph what the LexisNexis system is, which use casees it has and who are its reported customers. III. Sum up how RELX influences society by using the text.</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">**A:**</mark>&#x20;

<mark style="color:blue;">I. Thomson Reuters and RELX are two of the largest information conglomerates in the world. Thomson Reuters was founded in 2008, as a result of the merger between Thomson Corporation and Reuters Group. The company's primary business goals are to provide professionals with the intelligence, technology, and human expertise they need to find trusted answers. On the other hand, RELX, formerly known as Reed Elsevier, was founded in 1992 through the merger of Reed International, a British trade book and magazine publisher, and Elsevier, a Netherlands-based scientific publisher. The company aims to provide information and analytics for professional and business customers across industries.</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">II. LexisNexis is a legal research and business database service. It is an online research service for legal and business professionals available in over 60 countries. The system provides comprehensive legal research, business information, and news. It is used by law firms, government agencies, corporations, and academic institutions to retrieve and examine detailed information on legal issues, business developments, and current news events. The system's reported customers include legal professionals, law enforcement agencies, and businesses that require extensive legal and business information.</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">III. RELX significantly influences society in various ways. The company collects and sells personal data, which is used by various institutions to make decisions that directly impact individuals' lives. For instance, the data can be used to determine employment, custody of children, access to medication, and even the likelihood of arrest. The company's products have been used for surveillance purposes, such as spying on protesters and immigrants. Furthermore, RELX's data errors have resulted in people being denied access to their bank accounts, insurance, and housing. The company also privatizes public information, such as taxpayer-funded research and laws, making it difficult for the public to access critical information. This has led to the spread of misinformation and conspiracy theories.</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">**Q:**</mark> <mark style="color:blue;"></mark><mark style="color:blue;">How is the buisness model of RELX ? Please name the kind of data RELX collects and how they analyze and sell it by using scientific or press sources.</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">**A:**</mark>&#x20;

<mark style="color:blue;">RELX operates on a business model that involves collecting, analyzing, and selling data. The company is a conglomerate of publishers and data brokers, amassing a vast amount of information from various sources. This includes academic publications, business profiles, personal data, and legal information.</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">The data collected by RELX is diverse and extensive. It includes personal information about individuals, such as names, addresses, social security numbers, and other identifying details. It also includes data about people's behaviors, preferences, and associations. This data is collected from a variety of sources, including public records, online activities, and third-party data providers.</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">Once collected, the data is analyzed using advanced data-processing algorithms. These algorithms are designed to identify patterns, trends, and correlations within the data. The results of these analyses are then used to create a range of products and services. For example, RELX's LexisNexis Risk Solutions provides risk assessment products that help businesses, governments, and law enforcement agencies make informed decisions.</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">The company sells its data and analytics products to a wide range of customers. These include law enforcement agencies, employers, landlords, insurance companies, and other institutions. The data is used to make decisions about individuals, such as whether to hire them, rent to them, insure them, or even arrest them.</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">However, the company's business model has been criticized for its lack of transparency and accountability. Critics argue that RELX's practices infringe on individuals' privacy rights and can lead to discriminatory outcomes. They also argue that the company's privatization of public information, such as academic research and legal information, restricts access to important knowledge and resources.</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">**Q:**</mark> <mark style="color:blue;"></mark><mark style="color:blue;">Name a reported case where such decisions lead to bad influence to a specific group of society.</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">**A:**</mark> <mark style="color:blue;"></mark><mark style="color:blue;">One reported case where decisions based on data collected and analyzed by companies like RELX have had a negative impact on a specific group of society is in the realm of law enforcement and surveillance. As mentioned in the original text, RELX's LexisNexis products have been used by the government to spy on protesters' social media accounts and surveil immigrants.</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">In one instance, the LexisNexis system was reportedly used by police to spy on exes and even to blackmail women using the personal information the companyâ€™s policing products provide. This misuse of personal data not only infringes on individual privacy rights but also can lead to discriminatory practices and outcomes.</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">Furthermore, the use of such data in predictive policing algorithms has been criticized for perpetuating systemic biases. For example, if the data used to train these algorithms is based on historical policing data, it may reflect and perpetuate existing racial and socio-economic biases in law enforcement. This can lead to over-policing of certain communities and under-policing of others, exacerbating social inequalities and injustices.</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">In essence, the misuse of personal data collected and sold by companies like RELX can have serious implications for marginalized and vulnerable groups in society.</mark>
