# Book "Breaking the Social Media Prism: How to Make Our Platforms Less Polarizing"

Q: Please introduce the key findings of the book "Breaking the Social Media Prism: How to Make Our Platforms Less Polarizing" by namimg the theories used, which research the author conducted, which patterns he could analyse from each research method and which results she could conclude.

A: "Breaking the Social Media Prism" is a book authored by Chris Bail, a computational social scientist. In the book, he presents a combination of in-depth interviews, social media account analysis, experiments, and computational social science research. Below are the key findings of Bail's book:

Theories Used:

1. The Social Media Prism: Bail's primary argument revolves around the concept of a "social media prism", a metaphor he uses to describe how social media refracts our identities and creates distorted versions of ourselves.
2. The Theory of Identity Threats: The book discusses how people may change aspects of their identities when they perceive threats to their status or personal beliefs.

Research Conducted:

1. Experiments: Bail conducted a series of experiments, where he created a diverse and representative set of Twitter users and exposed them to opinions that were contrary to their own.
2. Interviews: The author carried out in-depth interviews from a diverse set of Twitter users to understand how they perceive polarization on social media.
3. Social Media Analysis: Bail conducted an extensive analysis of social media accounts to understand how individuals present their identities and interact with others.

Patterns Analysed:

1. Feedback Loop of Radicalisation: Bail identified a pattern of increasing extremism, where exposure to extreme points of view led to further radicalisation rather than changing the viewpoints of individuals.
2. Polarization: The author recognized how social media platforms create 'echo chambers', intensifying existing beliefs and resulting in extreme polarization.

Results Concluded:

1. Internet Moderates: Contrary to popular belief, Bail found that most social media users are more moderate than we think - it's the distorting social media prism that makes them appear more radical or polarized.
2. Ineffectiveness of Exposure to Opposing Views: The experiments revealed that exposure to contrary opinions on social media often does not lead to compromise or moderation. Instead, it can intensify one's pre-existing views.
3. The Amplification of Extreme Views: The social media prism often amplifies extreme views, reinforcing an individual's belief that such views are representative of the entire opposing group.
4. Role of Social Status: According to Bail, one's perceived social status can strongly influence their behaviour on social media. For example, individuals tend to adopt or perform more extreme views when their social status is under threat.

In conclusion, Bail suggests that a productive way to reduce polarization would be to convince people to stop performing such distorted versions of their identities on these platforms.



Q: Please explain detailed the point how exposure to extrem opposing views further strengthens radicalisation.

A: Bail theorizes a phenomenon he calls "the feedback loop of radicalisation". This concept suggests that when individuals with particular views are exposed to extreme opinions contrary to their own, rather than reconsidering their position or finding common ground, they become more defensive and tend to double down on their beliefs.

This happens for a couple of reasons:

1. Identity Threat: When people are confronted with views that challenge their own, it can feel like a threat to their identity, especially if those views are polar opposite or presented in a hostile manner. This threat causes them to defend their identity, leading to radicalisation of their own views.
2. Backfire Effect: This is a psychological phenomenon where individuals confronted with evidence against their beliefs tend to reject that evidence and believe even more strongly in their original viewpoints. This kind of exposure often triggers a form of cognitive dissonance where the person dismisses the new information and further entrenches in their existing beliefs.
3. Misinterpretation and Stereotyping: This effect is further bolstered by the amplification of extreme views on social media. When people see extreme views from the other side, they often aggregate and stereotype the entire opposing group based on those extreme beliefs. This creates a picture of 'us versus them,' which discourages middle ground or compromise.
4. Echo Chambers: Social media algorithms play a role in creating echo chambers by showing users more and more of the content they engage with, further verifying their beliefs. When an individual's news feeds are dominated by their own perspective, extreme opposite views feel much more alien, leading to more resistance.

Overall, the presumed antidote of exposing people to a wide range of views can, counterintuitively, increase polarisation rather than decrease it, especially when those views are presented in a confrontational manner or are extremely different from the person's existing conclusions. This underlines the complexity of addressing radicalisation and polarization on social media.



Q: There should be theoretically and extended version of this effect. People search on social media when they search for entertainment (boredom) or validation (struggle with themselves) but how does it fit that the opions on platforms like twitter are the most extrem than. Under the assumption people there should be under a constant threat of her identity but still the logging in ?

A: The details you are referring to are connected to human psychology and the design of social media platforms:

1. In-Group Validation: Typically, humans tend to seek validation from their in-group, the people who share similar values, beliefs, and behaviors. Social media, with its community structures and echo chambers, provides an easy platform for this, where opinions get reinforced instead of challenged.
2. Intensity of Engagement: Social media platforms are designed to promote content that generates engagement, and often, extreme opinions provoke strong reactions and therefore more engagement. Controversial or polarizing content can spark heated debates, making them more likely to be promoted by the platform's algorithm.
3. Social Status and Identity Performance: Bail suggests that users usually construct somewhat radical identities online due to perceived threats to their status. Extreme opinions gain more attention, and hence, individuals might use this approach to gain recognition, defend their social status, or get validation. This encourages a cycle of more extreme stances being adopted and portrayed online.
4. Desensitization: Continuous exposure to divisive content may desensitize users to extreme views over time, leading to a normalization of such opinions. In other words, constant confrontation with radical content may gradually push someone's tolerance threshold, hence 'normalizing' extremist viewpoints.
5. Escapism: Those who log into social media platforms for entertainment might unknowingly get drawn into the polarized world due to algorithms. For example, an algorithm might suggest a controversial video to a user because it's popular, and, out of curiosity or boredom, the user may watch it, thus exposing them to radical viewpoints.
6. Confirmation Bias: People also use social media to seek information that confirms their existing beliefs. Even if they encounter threatening ideas, they have a tendency to interpret or selectively recall information in a way that confirms their preexisting beliefs, ideas, or values.

These factors, combined with the 'feedback loop of radicalization' mentioned in the book, help explain why individuals consistently log into social media platforms even when they may be exposed to potentially threatening, opposite viewpoints.
