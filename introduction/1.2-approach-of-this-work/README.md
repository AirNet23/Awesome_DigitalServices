### 1.2 Approach of this Work

#### 1.2.1 General approach

I marked all goals of this work <mark style="color:orange;">orange</mark>.

In the first line this work is a try to <mark style="color:orange;">structure my thoughts and the information I could collect.</mark>&#x20;

In the second line I want to <mark style="color:orange;">find answers to some questions</mark> that accumulated with my previous researches. I hope asking and asking and asking will pave the way for change.



**I. Evolution of digital services**

I.I Why new digital services could replace the old persistent ways of communicating in society ?

I.II What were the disadvantages of the old services ?

I.III Why people prefer using the new services  over the old one ?

I.IV Why got the origins of young companies with at the first glance noble values of the founders so mutated to potential dangerous service ?



**II. Consequences and influence of digital services**

II.I Which (economical and technological) factors lead to the success of these services ?

II.II Which (social political, psychological, economical or military) flaws occur by using this services ?



**III. Perception of digital services**

If our digital services show extending privacy eroding behaviour and society transforming behavior:

III.I Why people don't act on the dangers of data extraction and behavioral prediction that lead to the erosion of individual privacy and autonomy, eventually manipulation of human behaviour and invasiv control over democratic socytiess and social order. (Consequences of surveillance capitalism; See chapter: Overview system theories > Intrusive digital economy ...)



Finally all of this question having answers with multiple aspects and perspective. But its hard to put these aspects into a big picture. <mark style="color:orange;">To provide a guide for developers of new services and policy makers my goal is to comprehend complexity by structuring aspects into a new thinking framework.</mark>

To be able to build such an framework I searched the internet for articles, papers on the questions and tried to find patterns. I decided to sum up the results of this articles as written conclusions about each source.&#x20;

Starting from this early approach I couldn't overcome the inherent restrictions by this: I will not reach any complete or near complete description soon by this. The suprising progress in LLM AI systems brought me to a solution: I decided to apply text summation and knowledge exploring capabilities of LLM's to structure my thoughts. By prompting the AI, with my summaries and conclusion, I should be able to transfer it into the right state to make thoughtfull extensions to my work. I used GPT-3 and later GPT-4 as assistance to generate answers. (Chapter 2. Research Results)

I continued by setting up a taxonomy for describing these digital services by myself and the material I read.&#x20;

I used Gpt-4 to rewrite this taxonomy and get suggestions on further readings (Chapter 4. Further sources and books). While I was adding short descriptions to every sub-point of the taxonomy they were used and rewritten by GPT-4.&#x20;

Later I used the results o

f GPT-4 to fill the sub points of the taxonomy. The next step was to pass the conclusions of Chapter 2. to GPT-4 and let it catalog it into the taxonomy. I also let GPT-4 generate its own further findings.

After improving it and fixing errors we could created a catalog of different properties and theories that can be used for description of the services. The „thinking framework“.



**Fourth** I decided to prompting the thinking framework with a choosen digital service into a LLM and let the model <mark style="color:orange;">outformulate the analysis about the service chapter by chapter.</mark> I want to analyse the following service regarding to social media:

\


| I Netflix        | VII Google News |
| ---------------- | --------------- |
| II TikTok        | VIII Instagram  |
| III BeReal       | IX Facebook.    |
| IV Snapchat      | X Chat-GPT      |
| V Whatsapp       | XI Spotify      |
| VI Google Search | XII Tinder      |

**Outlook**

I want to design a new social media service, by suggest solutions to discovered flaws in the persistent social media services, try out the technical realization of this solutions andfinally publish a prototype of a new service for web or as an app. However this is not part of this work and will require a leap up in work force, organisation and funding.

Maybe we can convince people of changing to a more accessible, democratic and secure technology by providing them an app or website that feels way more comfortable.

Its a glance of hope for me to be a contribute to the process that put our society back on the right track.
