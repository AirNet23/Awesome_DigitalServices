The start of

First I decided to create a thinking framework to help me to answer some questions:

_I Why new digital services could replace the old persistent ways of communicating in society ?_

_I.I Why people prefer using the new services (of google an facebook) over the old one ?_

_I.II Which economical and technological factors lead to the success of these services ?_

_III What were the disadvantages of the old services ?_

_IV Which social political, psychological, economical or military flaws occur by using this services ?_

_V Why people dont act on the dangers of surveilance capitalims ?“_

_VI Why got the origins of this companies got so mutated to dangerous service ?“_

To be able to build such an framework I searched the internet for articles, papers on the questions and tried to find patterns. I decided to sum up the results of this articles as written conclusions about each source.&#x20;

Starting from this early approach I couldn't overcome the inherent restrictions by this: I will not reach any complete or near complete description soon by this. The suprising progress in LLM AI systems brought me to a solution: I decided to apply text summaration and knwoledge exploring capabilites of LLM's to structure my thoughts. By prompting the AI, with my summaries and conclusion, I should be able to transfer it into the right state to make thoughtfull extensions to my work. I used GPT-3 and later GPT-4 as assistance to generate answers. (Chapter 2. Research Results)

I continued by setting up a taxonomy for describing these digital services by myself and the material I read.&#x20;

I used Gpt-4 to rewrite this taxonomy and get suggestions on further readings (Chapter 4. Further sources and books). While I was adding short descritptions to every subpoint of the taxonomy they were used and rewriten by GPT-4.&#x20;

Later I used the results of GPT-4 to fill the sub points of the taxonomy. The next step was to pass the conclusions of Chapter 2. to GPT-4 and let it catologuize it into the taxonomy. I also let GPT-4 generate its own further findings.

After improving it and fixing errors we could created a catalog of different properties and theories that can be used for description of the services. The „thinking framework“.

Finally I decided to input the thinking framework and let the model write the text chapter by chapter into the gpt-4 model on the different service of

Some contious work not covered in this article will be designing a new social media service,

by suggest solutions to discovered flaws in the persistent social media services,

try out the technical realization of this solutions and

finally publish a prototyp of a new service for web or as an app.

Maybe we can convince society of the advantages by providing them an app or website that feels way more comfortable to them. Its a glance of hope for me to be a contributen to the process that put our society back on the right track.
