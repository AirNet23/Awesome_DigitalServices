# I. Requests to GPT-4 to refine the proposed taxonomy



<mark style="color:blue;">**Q:**</mark> <mark style="color:blue;"></mark><mark style="color:blue;">Hi,</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">I am a student of society and computer science and want to create tools for our society that are more people serving than they we have currently to communicate, build relationships and define democratic consens. I believe for that we didnt find any powerful enough thinking frameworks to understand why we head to this situation with digital monopolists and gatekeepers controling information society. I strongly oppose the current state of society since the current system dont serve the people and is a mutated form of the original idea of the WWW with flourishing information diversity and enabeling peoples individual power to create and share.</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">I decided to creat a a thinking framework to help me to answer questions like „why did get companies like google and facebook grasp attenttion in the first place? “ „why people dont act on the dangers of surveilance capitalims ?“ „why got the origins of this companies got so mutated to dangerous service ?“ in the frist place. Second I will try to fix the flaws this service put on society by designing a new infromation service. Third I will try to convince the people of the advantages by providing them an app or website that feels way more comfortable to them. Fourth I hope I can contribute a building brick to the process that put our society back on the right track.</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">For designing the framework I researched the history of todays popular online services and how they changed the previous way of communicating in society and tried to recognice patterns.</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">By conducting my described research and by including information from the books and articles</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">**A:**</mark>&#x20;

<mark style="color:blue;">I propose the following framework that is divided along the timeline of this services and their integration into society. Than its further divided into describing basic building blocks (properties) their combinations (ermegent behaviour) and how our digital service integrated into this processes and what challenges they face now for society.</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">**I. Past: Roots and consilidation of our digital services (at time of creation of the service)**</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">I.I Digital Service promoting properties of human society</mark>

_<mark style="color:blue;">This section categorizes same basic properties of the system and the systems processes that our information society is build on.</mark>_

<mark style="color:blue;">I.I.I Properties of communication technology</mark>

_<mark style="color:blue;">This categorization was build on intensive research on communication protocols and data mining. Sadly I can no entagle my thoughts anymore since they also regard from my experience as computer scientist and computer science student.</mark>_

<mark style="color:blue;">I.I.I.I Information quality</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">- actuality</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">- contextuality / user relevance</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">- diversity</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">- communicativ motivation (e.x. economic effiency for producers and consumers, emotional value etc.)</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">I.I.I.II Information availability</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">- time independency</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">- location indenpendency</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">- scalability (hardware costs, time to build infrastructure etc.)</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">I.I.II Properties of Human needs</mark>

_<mark style="color:blue;">This categorization takes in respect that social media services worked best because the connected with a basic human need. That led to humans lending their attention to this platform.</mark>_

_<mark style="color:blue;">- not sure: Maybe we can adapt</mark>_ [<mark style="color:blue;">Maslow's hierarchy of needs</mark>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow's\_hierarchy\_of\_needs) _<mark style="color:blue;">to it..</mark>_

_<mark style="color:blue;">Im in lack of psychologic knowledge</mark>_

<mark style="color:blue;">I.I.III Properties of human interaction</mark>

_<mark style="color:blue;">This categorization takes in respect that humans can be very emphatically and like to communicate with each other. We as humans possesing a rich variety of spoken, visual, audial and tactiale language to express ourselves. This process creates a unique dynamic that is explored by scientistst and integrated into our digital services.</mark>_

<mark style="color:blue;">for example:</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">- Engagement on digtal services</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">- Communication dynamics</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">- Unformity and diversity of thoughts</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">- Replication of behaviour (group dynamics)</mark>

_<mark style="color:blue;">But I need help here because of the lack of sociologic knowledge.</mark>_

<mark style="color:blue;">I.I.IV Properties of our Society System (Capitalims)</mark>

_<mark style="color:blue;">This categorization takes in respect that humans decided to live in a captialistic society in the west. We shared the agreement that the trust in money and the techniques that are learned to deal with money will lead us into a brighter future as humanity. But this system forms our digital services, groups and society intentions. We need to observe them to undestand the effects on the product we wan tto build.</mark>_

<mark style="color:blue;">- Amplification & Self Amplification</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">- Market & Market defects</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">- Konglomeration</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">- Concurrency</mark>

_<mark style="color:blue;">I need help to enumerate them, because of a lack of economic studies.</mark>_

<mark style="color:blue;">I.II Emergent behaviour of properties</mark>

_<mark style="color:blue;">This section refers to effects that occurs as consequence of the combination of properties from I.I.</mark>_

_<mark style="color:blue;">Its a try to form a structure that can be later used to describe the companies (Google, Facebook, etc.) optimization of digital services into given processes that lead to their popularity.</mark>_

<mark style="color:blue;">I.II.I Synergias</mark>

_<mark style="color:blue;">This sections describes processes that are driven by combination of properties from different or the same category of I.I.</mark>_

<mark style="color:blue;">for example:</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">- Strong Audio-Video formats: The use of music and videos gives people a strong tool to communicate their experiences and feelings because they are self multilayered like this formats. In consequence people prefer to communicate and spending attention online services over exactly this format what leads to the popularity of digital services like TikTok who are building their interface around this human tendency.</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">I.II.II Further Emergent Effects</mark>

_<mark style="color:blue;">This section describes further emergent effects that are not fully described by synergias.</mark>_

_<mark style="color:blue;">- … I need help to identify them, currently I lack of abstraction ability to apply system bible and emergent effects on my examples</mark>_

<mark style="color:blue;">I.III Success of digital services by integration into existing properties and Synergias</mark>

_<mark style="color:blue;">This section describes how in a general way different today popular digital services integrated the properties and processes of I.I – I.II into their products.</mark>_

_<mark style="color:blue;">I couldnt write the section because I.I and I.II are incomplete but in my researches and summarys I found different clues on it that definitly need more structurization.</mark>_

<mark style="color:blue;">I.III.I Common integrated properties</mark>

_<mark style="color:blue;">I lack of information</mark>_

<mark style="color:blue;">I.III.II Common integrated emergent properties and emergent processes</mark>

_<mark style="color:blue;">I lack of information</mark>_

<mark style="color:blue;">I.III.III Challenges on scaling</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">- legal problems (right management companies, payment of creators)</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">- technical issues (no availability of consumer devices, slow internet)</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">- financial problems (dotcom bubble etc)</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">- user acceptance</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">- Competions practices</mark>

_<mark style="color:blue;">I can add information to this section already but it will be very unstructured and not comperable between the services. Need help.</mark>_

<mark style="color:blue;">I.III.IV Their developed buisness Models</mark>

_<mark style="color:blue;">I lack of completly understanding them. Even I could try describe them for google and Spotify. Need help.</mark>_

<mark style="color:blue;">**II. Present: Digital services as driver of society change**</mark>

_<mark style="color:blue;">This section exists because their are countless advantages (better, cheaper inforamtion, education higher individual range of content) and flaws (secure criminal communication, mental health decline, manipulation of opinions, fake news, less physical activites, addiction to digital services, discrimination of minorities by the algortihm – described by the facebook papers, cambridge analytica scandal and and and) in our digital servies</mark>_

<mark style="color:blue;">II.I Common Effects on Society</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">- Influence on mental health</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">- Influence on human relationsships and communication</mark>

_<mark style="color:blue;">I discovered a thing will researching: People report a increasing level of loneless and on surface relationsships in our modern society. My thesis is that this is a combination out of the amount of time they spent online and the individual content that they getting shown. It seems that individualization can move them away from their friends because they share increasingly less common experiences with each other.</mark>_

<mark style="color:blue;">- Influence on physic health</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">- Influcence on military actions</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">- Influcence on politic actions</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">- Influence on democratic discurs</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">- Influence on economic and wealth</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">- Influence on information access</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">II.II Feedback from Society on digital services</mark>

_<mark style="color:blue;">- This section exists because successfull internet companies build their services on continous and repetetiv user feedback. For example google uses A/B testing for their apps, beta versions for user interfaces and changes on the algorithm to maximize advertising revenue. Even when I cna extract soem.. infromatin from „Weapons of Math destruction“ and „Age of surveilance capitalism“ Im in lack of understanding to describe this processes on other internet companies (facebook, spoitify, netflix etc...)</mark>_

<mark style="color:blue;">**III. Future: Unsolved challenges and trends on digital services**</mark>

_<mark style="color:blue;">This sections should provide a direction how we can develop our current situation. I propose the following general scheme on what is good for society:</mark>_\
_<mark style="color:blue;">- High individuality of thoughts between individual humans</mark>_

_<mark style="color:blue;">- High amount of effective communication and sharing of thoughts between humans</mark>_

_<mark style="color:blue;">- Adaptive Independence of individal humans: Thoughts shouldnt be restricted, Actions should be restricted if they tackle the morals of live and self independence up to community level.</mark>_

_<mark style="color:blue;">- High sustainability of humans society and actions.</mark>_

<mark style="color:blue;">III.I Continous Flaws</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">III.I.I Failure description</mark>

_<mark style="color:blue;">This section should provide the flaws we need to work on for our new digital product.</mark>_

_<mark style="color:blue;">Ideally we could indentify a worrysome integration of our digital services into processes and properties enumerated in I. And II.</mark>_

<mark style="color:blue;">For example:</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">- Declining quality of informal news content: Reduced spending to journalists loans due reduced income through add revenue on traditional newspapers and shift of advertisment to Googles Adword system.</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">III.I.II Research Efforts</mark>

_<mark style="color:blue;">This section should provide an overview of our current state and new recognitions how we can tackle this flaws. Besides of Shuboff I dont discovered any structured literature on this topic. A summary about research efforts on the given points in III.I would be very helpful.</mark>_

<mark style="color:blue;">III.I.III Regulatory Efforts</mark>

_<mark style="color:blue;">This section should provide of current laws and regulatory processes that restirct negative effects on society and amplify positive effects on society.</mark>_

<mark style="color:blue;">- GDPR (EU)</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">- NetzDG</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">- Digital Acts wtih US...</mark>\
_<mark style="color:blue;">Im in lack of policy knwoledge to evaluate these efforts.</mark>_

<mark style="color:blue;">III.I.IV Solutions due New Digital Services</mark>

_<mark style="color:blue;">This section should provide an overview over new digital services and their tackling and answers to this flaws.</mark>_

_<mark style="color:blue;">Im in lack of market knowledge and flaw descrition to write this section.</mark>_

<mark style="color:blue;">III.II Trends</mark>

_<mark style="color:blue;">This section should make an interpolation where the effects of II.I Common Effects on Society and II.II Feedback from Society on digital services leds us humans to if we didnt change them.</mark>_

_<mark style="color:blue;">Each subpoint should also take in regard positive impulses from III.I.II – III.I.IV.</mark>_

_<mark style="color:blue;">It should give a glance how the world of tomorrow could look like.</mark>_

_<mark style="color:blue;">I am doubting to writing this section because its basically future telliing.</mark>_

<mark style="color:blue;">III.II.I Properties of communication technology</mark>

_<mark style="color:blue;">I need help, more knowledge and structure to write this section.</mark>_

<mark style="color:blue;">III.II.II Properties of Human needs</mark>

_<mark style="color:blue;">I need help, more knowledge and structure to write this section.</mark>_

<mark style="color:blue;">III.II.III Properties of human interaction</mark>

_<mark style="color:blue;">I need help, more knowledge and structure to write this section.</mark>_

<mark style="color:blue;">III.II.IV Properties of our society system</mark>

_<mark style="color:blue;">I need help, more knowledge and structure to write this section.</mark>_

<mark style="color:blue;">**Due to my basic knowledge my model is surely flawed. Please make propositions for changes, execute them enrich my model with information and write the subpoints :)**</mark>

**I also request further information from GPT-4:**

<mark style="color:blue;">**Q:**</mark> <mark style="color:blue;"></mark><mark style="color:blue;">Due to my basic knowledge my model is surely flawed. Please make propositions for changes, execute them enrich my model with information and write the subpoints :)</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">**A:**</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">**I. Past: Roots and consolidation of our digital services (at the time of creation of the service)**</mark>

_<mark style="color:blue;">**I.I.II Properties of Human needs**</mark>_

<mark style="color:blue;">Instead of directly adapting Maslow's hierarchy of needs, you can focus on some key human needs that digital services cater to, such as:</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">- Connection and belonging (social networks like Facebook)</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">- Information and knowledge (search engines like Google)</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">- Entertainment and relaxation (streaming services like Netflix and Spotify)</mark>

_<mark style="color:blue;">**I.I.III Properties of human interaction**</mark>_

<mark style="color:blue;">Here are some concepts to consider for this section:</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">- Social presence theory: the degree to which people feel a sense of social connection through digital communication</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">- Media richness theory: the ability of a communication medium to reproduce the information sent over it</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">- Network effects: the value of a service increases as more people use it</mark>

_<mark style="color:blue;">**I.III.IV Their developed business models**</mark>_

<mark style="color:blue;">To understand the business models of major internet companies, you can refer to resources like:</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">- Anderson, C. (2009). Free: The Future of a Radical Price. New York, NY: Hyperion.</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">- Chaffey, D., & Ellis-Chadwick, F. (2019). Digital Marketing. Harlow, England: Pearson Education Limited.</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">**II. Present: Digital services as a driver of society change**</mark>

_<mark style="color:blue;">**II.II Feedback from Society on digital services**</mark>_

<mark style="color:blue;">To understand user feedback processes in internet companies, you can explore resources on user-centered design, usability testing, and customer feedback management. Some examples include:</mark>
