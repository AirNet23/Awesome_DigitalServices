**I.II Yahoo (1994) vs. Google (1998)**

<mark style="color:blue;">**Q:**</mark> <mark style="color:blue;"></mark><mark style="color:blue;">How people searched the internet before Google?</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">**A:**</mark> <mark style="color:blue;"></mark><mark style="color:blue;">GPT-3: Before there was Google, people used other ways to search the Internet. One popular way was to use directories like Yahoo! or DMOZ. A directory is a website that catalogs websites and their information. This made it easier for people to find what they were looking for on the Internet.</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">**Q:**</mark> <mark style="color:blue;"></mark><mark style="color:blue;">Why Users prefered Google over directories</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">**A:**</mark> <mark style="color:blue;"></mark><mark style="color:blue;">One of the reasons people preferred Google over directories was because it had a more advanced search engine. Google could find websites quicker and easier than a directory could. Another reason people preferred Google was because it had an index that was constantly updated. This meant that the user would get the most up-to-date information possible.</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">**Q:**</mark> <mark style="color:blue;"></mark><mark style="color:blue;">5 reasons why people prefered google over directories</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">**A:**</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">**1. Number of Results:**</mark> <mark style="color:blue;"></mark><mark style="color:blue;">When you search for something on Google, you generally get more relevant results than if you were to use a directory. This is because directories are usually limited to a specific category or group of websites, while Google indexes millions of websites regularly, so you’re likely to find what you’re looking for no matter what it is.</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">**2. Speed:**</mark> <mark style="color:blue;"></mark><mark style="color:blue;">Google also tends to be much faster than traditional online directories. In fact, one study showed that people who used Google as their primary search engine returned almost double the number of pages in comparison with those who used Yahoo! and AltaVista—directories included in the study.</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">**3. Categorization:**</mark> <mark style="color:blue;"></mark><mark style="color:blue;">Another issue with online directories is that they can be very difficult to navigate. Often times, sites are listed without any real organization scheme whatsoever, making it hard (or even impossible) for users to find what they’re looking for quickly and easily. With its complex algorithm-driven categorization system, Google makes it easy for users to zero in on exactly what they need without having to spend hours browsing through irrelevant links and pages.</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">**4 . Accuracy:**</mark> <mark style="color:blue;"></mark><mark style="color:blue;">Finally, one key advantage that Google has over most online directories is accuracy . Because its indexing process is so sophisticated , the chances of finding incorrect information when using Google are much lower than when relying on other sources.</mark>

**Fazit:**

Google konnte die Qualität und Menge der Suchergebnisse von Webseiten Katalogen übertreffen, da es das Indizieren von Webseiten automatisierte. Durch die Vielzahl an Ergebnissen und die Verarbeitbarkeit von Text in HTML erhöhte sich die Wahrscheinlichkeit für gute Ergebnisse. Der Nutzer erhielt in der Regel den Zugang zur doppelten Menge an relevanten Informationen.

Außerdem enthielten Suchkataloge statische Kategorien ohne einheitliches Schema zwischen den Katalogen. Das Gruppierungschema ist durch den Google-Suchalgorithmus dort viel feingliedriger, dynamischer und wird an den Nutzer angepasst.

**III.III Napster**† **(1999) vs. I-Tunes (2001)**

<mark style="color:blue;">**Q:**</mark> <mark style="color:blue;"></mark><mark style="color:blue;">Why was I-Tunes successful ?</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">**A:**</mark> <mark style="color:blue;"></mark><mark style="color:blue;">GPT-3: „ITunes was launched in 2001 as a way for Apple to control how users purchased and listened to music. The platform allowed users to purchase songs or albums directly from Apple, as well as listen to previously purchased songs and browse their friends’ music libraries. ITunes quickly became the dominant digital music store, with more than 70% market share by 2006.</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">One of the reasons for iTunes’s success was that it made it easy for people to buy individual tracks rather than entire albums. T</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">→ This shift away from buying physical CDs had a significant impact on the music industry. Record labels began releasing singles instead of full-length albums, figuring that people would be more likely to buy one or two catchy new tracks rather than an entire album. As sales of physical CDs continued to decline, record labels started relying more and more on revenue from digital downloads through services like iTunes.</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">Many consumers also blamed ITunes for killing music sharing . Before iTunes came along, peer-to-peer file sharing networks like Napster were incredibly popular for downloading pirated copies of songs and movies. <-> But when iTunes introduced its own built-in file sharing feature, many people stopped using Napster and other peer-to-peer networks in favor of downloading files from ITunes directly. This led some people to argue that ITunes was responsible for killing off illegal music piracy altogether</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">**Q:**</mark> <mark style="color:blue;"></mark><mark style="color:blue;">Why people prefered ITunes over Napster ?</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">**A:**</mark> <mark style="color:blue;"></mark><mark style="color:blue;">GPT-3: Napster was the first major peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing service. It was founded in 1999 by Shawn Fanning and Sean Parker, both of whom were students at Northeastern University in Boston. Napster allowed users to share files of any type with other users on the network. The service became incredibly popular, largely because it made it easy for people to share their music collections with each other. Comment: Because music was distrubted mostly through CD’s at this point of time and the distributers not willingly published digital media I suppose that Napstere was used by technical skilled people that could digitalize tracks.</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">There used to be a music sharing site called Napster that allowed users to share songs for free. However, in 2001, () the site was shut down by court order after it was sued by major record labels for copyright infringement.</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">Comment: Napster went bakrupt after loosing some legal fights in 2002.</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">The reason the record labels were able to sue Napster so successfully was because of its business model. Unlike other file-sharing sites at the time, which allowed users to download any song they wanted, Napster had a system where users could only access songs if they were already owned by another user on the network. This meant that instead of downloading entire albums or even individual tracks, most users would just listen to 30-second clips of each song. This made it very easy for the record labels to track down and sue anyone who was illegally sharing their music.</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">„However, things changed in</mark> <mark style="color:blue;"></mark>~~<mark style="color:blue;">2003</mark>~~ <mark style="color:blue;"></mark><mark style="color:blue;">2001 when Apple released its own music player and store called iTunes. Unlike Napster, iTunes allowed users to download full songs and albums legally at prices much lower than those charged by traditional brick-and-mortar (local) stores like Tower Records or HMV . At first, many people thought that this would spell doom for Apple's competitors like Microsoft Windows Media Player and RealNetworks'RealPlayer , but it soon became clear that iTunes was actually killing off Napster . The main reason for this was convenience: with iTunes , you didn't have to go through the hassle of finding individual tracks online – you could just purchase them direct from Apple's servers“ Itunes allowed users to share files of songs between each other.</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">**Q: Name 5 reasons why people prefered I-Tunes over Napster**</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">1.Napster was launched in 1999 as a music file-sharing service, which allowed users to share files of songs between each other.</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">2.ITunes was developed by Apple Inc and released in 2001 as a media player application that could be used to purchase and listen to music on personal computers.</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">3.One of the main reasons why people prefered ITunes over napster was because ITunes offered a more user-friendly experience than napster did at the time. For example, with ITunes you could preview songs before purchasing them, which napster did not offer at the time.</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">4.Another reason why people prefered iTunes over Napster was because it had a larger selection of songs available for download than Napster did back then (although this has changed somewhat since then).</mark>

**Fazit:**

Apple gelang es das Konzept von Napster mit all seinen Vorteilen für die Nutzer (Preis, Individualisierung) zu übernehmen und gegen rechtliche Risiken abzusichern. Apple nutzte die Popularität seiner Marke, die es mit dem Iphone erzeugt hatte, um Itunes als „Beigabe“-Verkauf an den Markt zu bringen und sicherte sich schlagartig damit die Marktstellung.

Apple vorinstallierte ITunes auf ihrem Player dem IPod und nutzte die Bequemlichkeit der Menschen (option as Default, wie beim Google Chrome Browser) und die Kontrolle über die eigenen Hardware zum Durchsetzen ihrer Plattform.

**III.IV WinAmp (1997) vs. YouTube (2005)**

<mark style="color:blue;">**Q:**</mark> <mark style="color:blue;"></mark><mark style="color:blue;">Explain 5 reasons why YouTube become popular ?</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">**A:**</mark> <mark style="color:blue;"></mark><mark style="color:blue;">1. Youtube is a video sharing website where users can upload, share, and view videos.</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">2. The site was created by three former PayPal employees in February 2005.</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">3. It was first introduced as a video dating site called "Tune In Hook Up".</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">4. However, it soon became a platform for user-generated content and now hosts billions of videos.</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">5. There are many reasons why Youtube has become so popular over the years: here are five of them!</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">5 Reasons Why Youtube Got So Popular:</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">1)It's free - Unlike traditional television channels, there is no subscription fee required to watch videos on YouTube. This makes it an affordable option for people from all walks of life.</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">2)There's something for everyone - With millions of videos uploaded each day, you're guaranteed to find something that interests you on YouTube. From music to makeup tutorials, there's something for everyone!</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">3) It's convenient - You can access YouTube from anywhere in the world via your computer or mobile device without ever having to leave your home or office. What could be more convenient than that?</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">4) The commenting system allows viewers to engage with creators and other viewers - Comments sections on YouTube offer unique opportunities for interaction between creators and fans as well as among fans themselves (known as 'comment trolling'). This creates a sense of community around certain channels and encourages people to keep coming back for more content they like</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">**Q:**</mark> <mark style="color:blue;"></mark><mark style="color:blue;">Why people dont stream content via media player anymore ?</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">**A:**</mark> <mark style="color:blue;"></mark><mark style="color:blue;">There are many reasons why people don't stream media content via media players anymore. One reason is that most modern web browsers have built-in support for streaming video and audio content without the need for additional software. Another reason is that many websites now use HTML5 to embed multimedia content, which means it can be streamed directly in a web browser without the need for any plugins. Additionally, using a web browser to stream content is often more convenient than using a separate media player application, since all of your browsing activities (including streaming videos) can be consolidated into one place.</mark>

**Summary:**

**MediaPlayer:**

\- Benutzer benötigen spätestens ab HTML 5 keine zusätzliche Software zu ihrem Browser um Videos zu streamen. Der Browser ist die komfortabelste Lösung, da dort die gesamte WWW Erfahrung stattfindet.

**YouTube**

\- YouTube besitzt mehrere Vorteile: gratis Nutzung, eine hohe Vielfalt an Material und Themen, Kommentarsystem für Engagement und eine leichte Zugänglichkeit

**III.V YouTube (2005) vs. Twitch (2011)**

<mark style="color:blue;">**Why does people prefer streaming over Twitch than other platforms ?**</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">1. Twitch is a live streaming video platform that focuses on video gaming, including playthroughs of games, broadcasts of game-related events, and creative content.</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">2. It was founded in June 2011 by Justin Kan and Emmett Shear as a spin-off from the general-interest streaming service Justin.tv.</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">3. In February 2014, Twitch announced it had more than 1 million broadcasters and 100 million viewers per month.\<ref name="variety/twitch">\</ref></mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">4. By August 2015, it had reached 2+ million broadcasters and 45+ million monthly viewers.\<ref>\[https://blog.twitchapp.com/august-2015-update-9adbadc73977 Twitch Blog: August 2015 Update]\</ref> 5 Its prominence has grown to the point where it was described in 2017 by The Verge as "the ESPN of esports".</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">It is a great platform for watching live streams of people playing video games, which can be really entertaining.</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">2. There are many different channels to choose from, so it is likely that everyone will find something they enjoy watching.</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">3. The chat feature allows viewers to interact with each other and the streamer in real time, making the experience more engaging.</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">4. Viewers can earn rewards by participating in chat or subscribing to certain channels. This gives them an incentive to keep coming back and interacting with others on the site.</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">- There are many reasons why people prefer streaming on Twitch. Some of the key reasons include:</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">1) Variety of Content: Twitch offers a vast array of content that is different from traditional television. There is something for everyone on Twitch, whether you’re interested in gaming, art, music, or just watching others chat and have fun.</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">2) Community Atmosphere: The community on Twitch is one of the best aspects about the platform. People are friendly and generous with their time and knowledge, and it’s a great place to make friends from all over the world.</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">3) Interactivity: One of the things that makes streaming so unique is the interactivity between broadcaster and viewer. This creates a more personal connection than what you would find with traditional TV programming.

<mark style="color:blue;">4) Convenience: Streaming is incredibly convenient- all you need is an internet connection and you can watch whatever you want whenever you want (as long as there’s someone broadcasting). You don’t have to worry about commercials or trying to find a good show to watch at specific time slots; everything you could ever want to watch is just a few clicks away on Twitch.</mark>

**Fazit:**

**Twitch:**

\- Wie YouTube ist Twitch eine Plattform mit hoher Zugänglichkeit und großer Angebotsvielfalt.

**III.V Youtube (2005) vs. PeerTube (2017)**

<mark style="color:blue;">**What are the pros and cons of P2P streaming ?**</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">Peer-to-peer (P2P) streaming is a way of sharing digital content between computers without the need for a central server. This type of streaming usually refers to video or music files, and can be done through websites or software applications. While P2P streaming does have some benefits – such as being able to share large files without having to use up storage space on your own computer – it has several downsides compared to using mainstream online video services like YouTube.</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">The first downside of P2P streaming is that it can often be difficult to find what you are looking for. Because there is no central database, finding specific videos or music can be time consuming and frustrating. Additionally, many P2P streams are illegal copies of copyrighted works, so there is always the risk that you could end up downloading something you shouldn’t.</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">Another downside of P2P streaming is that the quality of the videos and music tends to be lower than what you would find on mainstream services like YouTube. This may be because not all videos have been encoded at a high enough quality, or because they are being streamed from a computer rather than from an officially licensed source. Comment: This is a consequence from distrubuted technology knwoledge of users and missing contracts to mainstream creators.</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">In addition, issues like buffering time and interruptions in service can make using P2P Streaming frustrating and inconvenient experiences compared with using well-established services like YouTube</mark>

**Summary:**

**P2P:**

\- Vorteil: Dateien können in auf die Peers verteit werden. Zum Abruf oder Veröffentlichung muss eine große Datei nicht auf dem eigenen Rechner bleiben

\- P2P Anwendungen wißene folgende Nachteile auf: Suchbarkeit, Rechtliche Schwierigkeiten mit den Urhhebern, Qualität des geteilten Materials und technische Schwierigkeiten, wie Buffering undDienstausfälle

**VI.I HomePage-Blog (1989\[2]) vs. MySpace (2003)**

<mark style="color:blue;">**Q:**</mark> <mark style="color:blue;"></mark><mark style="color:blue;">\[not documented while writing]</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">**A:**</mark> <mark style="color:blue;"></mark><mark style="color:blue;">The main reason most internet users prefer social media over blogs is because it is a more efficient way to communicate. With social media, you can share links, images, and videos much faster than you can with a blog. Additionally, social media platforms are typically more user-friendly than blogging platforms. This makes them simpler for people to navigate and use. Finally, social media sites usually have a wider audience than most bloggers do. As such, your content has the potential to reach more people if you post it on a social networking site rather than on a personal blog.</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">There are a number of reasons why blogs “died.” The first reason is that social media platforms, such as Facebook and Twitter, became more popular. These platforms allowed people to share short snippets of information, which was perfect for the 140-character limit on tweets or the one-minute videos on YouTube. Blogging required more effort because bloggers had to write longer posts, and people were less likely to read them if they could just scroll through their Facebook News Feed instead.</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">Another reason why blogs died is that Google changed its algorithm in 2011 so that websites with fresh content would rank higher in search results than those without new content. This change encouraged businesses to start blogging because it helped their website ranking, but it also resulted in most blogs becoming stale and outdated over time. As a result, readers stopped visiting them as often and they lost their influence online.</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">Social media platforms are designed for easy communication and interaction between users. This allows people to share their thoughts and ideas more easily than through a blog.</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">2. Blogging can be quite time consuming, whereas updating your social media account is a much simpler process.</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">3. Most social media sites have built-in features that allow you to share photos and videos w</mark>ith <mark style="color:blue;">your friends, which makes the site more engaging and fun to use.</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">4. Social media platforms are constantly evolving, so there are always new features being added that keep users interested in using them.</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">5. Many social media sites are free to use, which makes them an appealing option for budget-conscious consumers</mark>

**Fazit:**

Mehrere Faktoren spielen eine Rolle, wieso Social Media Plattformen Blogs übertroffen haben.

\- Social Media Plattformen konzentrieren sich darauf, die Kernaktionen der Kommunikation (Teilen, Liken, Veröffentlichen) so komfortabel und mit wenig zeitaufwand wie möglich zugänglich zu machen.

\- Für Contetn Creator ist die Erstellung von Social Media Content einfacher und wird durch diverse Mittel unterstützt (s. Snapchat.)

\- Die Plattformen sind so gestaltet, dass leicht navigiert werden kann und Kernaktionen schnell ausgeführt werden.

\- Social Media Plattformen haben wegen ihren Vorteilen eine höhere Nutzerzahl und bieten deshalb mehr Vielfalt an Content und ein größeres Publikum. (→ Kritische Masse überschritten)

\- Social Media Plattformen sind SEO, da sie durch ihren oft neuen Content von Google bevorzugt werden.

\- Inhalte auf Social media Plattformen hatten höhere Wahrscheinlichkeit im Kampf um die Aufmerksamkeit der Nutzer zu bestehen, da sie von den Plattformen au fkürze optimiert wurden und dem Nutzer automatisch präsentiert werden.

**IV.II Amazon (1994) vs. Ebay (1995)**

<mark style="color:blue;">**Q:**</mark> <mark style="color:blue;"></mark><mark style="color:blue;">Enumerate 5 reasons why people prefer online dating over news paper advertisments</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">**A:**</mark> <mark style="color:blue;"></mark><mark style="color:blue;">1. People can be very selective when choosing a potential partner through online dating platforms. This is because people can view the profiles of interested parties and decide if they want to get to know them better.</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">2. Online dating platforms provide a safer environment for singles than meeting someone you've met from a newspaper ad. You can screen all potential dates before agreeing to meet them in person which minimizes your chances of being scammed or hurt physically and emotionally.</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">3. Singles often have more choices on online dating platforms than they do when searching for partners through newspapers ads where it might be more difficult to find someone who meets their specific criteria e.g., location, age, religion etc..</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">4. Dating websites allow singles to communicate with each other through emails and chat rooms before deciding whether or not they would like to take things further by arranging a date offline . This helps singles get an idea about the other person's personality traits and interests without having to commit too much time or energy upfront .</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">5 Singles using dating websites generally pay less money than those who subscribe to traditional matchmaking agencies</mark>
