# 3. Research Results

For the research I decided to do a comparision between similar (digital) services that are predecessor and successor based on their publication date. By this approach I believe the change of finding some static and changing elements of this services is the highest. Also It could be possible to spot some trends in the feature development of digital social services especially social media.

By ordering the services by their dominant function I created a structure. Platforms that are now offline are marked with a cross † and were not considered for further comparision.

The following questions are a template for a detailed mid length summary of the given text:

<mark style="color:blue;">**Q:**</mark>&#x20;

<mark style="color:blue;">\[PUT YOUR TEXT TO SUMMARIZE HERE]</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">I.III Which other factors provided an advantages to the new service that it could grow in the market I.IV Which other factors provided an disadvantage to the old service that it declined in the market ? I.V Why new digital services could replace the prevalent ways of a specific communication style in society ?</mark>&#x20;

<mark style="color:blue;">Write an detailed summary of the text. Try to answer the questions with the texts information. For each question form one ore more sense sections. SKIP questions, where there is no information in the text. KEEP THE ORDER of the questions if possible. WRITE DOWN the number of the question that got answered. AVOID general terms for an explanation, use examples if given. DON'T mix sense sections referring to different questions. DON'T provide information that is not in the text.</mark>

**I will publish results soon.**
