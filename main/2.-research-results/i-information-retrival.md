Context: Quora question: "How did people search on the web before search engines were created?"

**Part I -** [**Tom Peracchio**](https://www.quora.com/profile/Tom-Peracchio) **answer**

<mark style="color:blue;">**Q:**</mark> <mark style="color:blue;"></mark><mark style="color:blue;">\[Research query documented in chapter 3., Text: source part, Service name: Manual index search]</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">**A:**</mark> <mark style="color:blue;"></mark><mark style="color:blue;">Before search engines, directories like Yahoo! were prevalent in the mid-1990s, fulfilling similar functions in communication. These directories were influenced by the social environment of the time, which relied heavily on telephone directories for finding information. However, these prevalent services had disadvantages such as limited search capabilities and a lack of organization. People preferred using digital services like Yahoo! and AltaVista because they offered more efficient and organized ways to find information. The rise of the internet and the decline of traditional communication methods like rotary phones and telephone directories contributed to the growth of digital services and the decline of prevalent services. The digital services changed how people communicated by providing faster and more convenient ways to access information.</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">**Q:**</mark> <mark style="color:blue;"></mark><mark style="color:blue;">\[Research query documented in chapter 3., Text: source part, Service name: Manual index search]</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">**A:**</mark> <mark style="color:blue;"></mark><mark style="color:blue;">The text discusses the early days of the internet when a simple directory was sufficient to keep track of websites. Services like Akebono at Stanford University provided categorized directories of web pages. As the number of sites grew, search engines like AltaVista, Inktomi, and Excite@Home emerged, using web spiders to crawl and index websites. However, these early search engines were simplistic and often provided frustrating and useless search results.</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">I.III: The disadvantages of the prevalent services included their simplicity, limited capacity to keep track of the growing number of websites, and the often frustrating and useless search results they provided.</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">I.IV: People preferred using these early search engines over directories because they offered a more comprehensive index of websites and the ability to search for specific content.</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">III.I: Positive consequences of using these early search engines included easier access to information and a more comprehensive index of websites.</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">III.II: Negative consequences of using these early search engines included frustrating and often useless search results due to their simplistic nature.</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">IV.I: User benefits of these early search engines included easier access to information and a more comprehensive index of websites. Disadvantages included frustrating and often useless search results.</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">IV.II: The overall perception of the user to these early search engines is not mentioned in the text.</mark>

**Part III - Richard Conto answer**

<mark style="color:blue;">**Q:**</mark> <mark style="color:blue;"></mark><mark style="color:blue;">\[Research query documented in chapter 3., Text: source part, Service name: Manual index search]</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">**A:**</mark> <mark style="color:blue;"></mark><mark style="color:blue;">Before search engines like Google, there were various information sharing services on the Internet, such as NNTP, UUCP, Gopher, FTP, and email. People would often publish pages of links to things, and in some cases, send requests via email to see a directory of retrievable items. Users would also subscribe to information distribution lists to search for content.</mark>

**-** In January 1994, Yang and Filo were electrical engineering graduate students at [Stanford University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford\_University), when they created a website named "Jerry and David's guide to the World Wide Web".[\[9\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!%22%20/l%20%22cite\_note-9)[\[10\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!%22%20/l%20%22cite\_note-How\_Jerry-10)[\[11\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!%22%20/l%20%22cite\_note-11)[\[12\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!%22%20/l%20%22cite\_note-12)

\- The site was a human-edited [web directory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web\_directory), organized in a hierarchy, as opposed to a searchable index of pages. In March 1994, "Jerry and David's Guide to the World Wide Web" was renamed "Yahoo!" and became known as the [Yahoo Directory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!\_Directory)

\- Yahoo was incorporated on March 2, 1995. In 1995, a [search engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search\_engine) function, called Yahoo Search, was introduced. This allowed users to search Yahoo Directory.[\[22\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!%22%20/l%20%22cite\_note-22)[\[23\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!%22%20/l%20%22cite\_note-23) Yahoo soon became the first popular online directory and search engine on the [World Wide Web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World\_Wide\_Web).[\[24\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!%22%20/l%20%22cite\_note-24)

\- By 1998, Yahoo was the most popular starting point for web users,[\[27\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!%22%20/l%20%22cite\_note-27) and the human-edited Yahoo Directory the most popular search engine,[\[15\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!%22%20/l%20%22cite\_note-Directory-15) receiving 95 million page views per day, triple that of rival Excite.[\[25\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!%22%20/l%20%22cite\_note-auto-25) It also made many high-profile acquisitions.

\- Yahoo Directory \[was a] (...) hand-compiled list of websites, organized into topics. Now, the venerable Yahoo Directory is closing.

**-** When Yahoo began in 1994, the most common way people found websites was to browse through lists, where sites were often organized into topics.

\- Founders Jerry Yang and David Filo quickly realized their own list needed a better name than “Jerry and David’s Guide to the World Wide Web.” They settled on Yahoo! (with exclamation mark). That stood for “Yet Another Hierarchical Officious Oracle” — a reference to organizing sites in a hierarchical order.

\- A “directory” relies on humans to review websites, summarize them with short descriptions and organize them into a categories. When Yahoo started, this **system was effective,** because there weren’t that many pages on the web (relatively speaking) and automated search technology to organize websites wasn’t very good.

\- \[This organisation of information] contributed in a big way Yahoo’s popularity over traditional search engines like InfoSeek or Excite that used automation. **Yahoo had better relevance.** You could find what you were looking for.

\- Yahoo was so popular that publishers had real worries about getting included. From around 1996-1999, there were long delays to list new sites. Sites that did get in could find they were effectively invisible because a Yahoo editor might have changed their descriptions in a way that didn’t include important keywords.

**Conclusion:**

\- Yahoo was first an human sorted and hierachical structured website dictionary and later develped into an interface for an search service based on that dictionary.

\- It provided a surplus to many users because it provided relevant results. This was possible, because the amount of websites was not so high and it could be easy structured and sorted by humans.

Relevanz: _„As of Jan. 2020, Google owned 87.4% of the global market share of search engines“_

\- Google veröffentlicht Prototypen eines Produktes und überarbeitet es durch den Einsatz der gewonnen Daten kontinuierlich. Nach dem Start wurden die Suchalgorithmen kontinuierlich verbessert und zog so mehr Leute an.

\- Googles erstes Geschäftsmodell war eine Suchmaschine, die Menschen half über Algorithmen die Übersicht über eine riesige Menge an Daten zu erhalten und genaue Suchergebnisse lieferte.

Früher mussten sich Menschen mit dem Sortieren der Informationen beschäftigen. Googles Algorithmen bewerten den Inhalt zu einem Suchwort automatisch.

Dabei wurden zunächst neue Techniken, wie eingehende Links, als Vertrauensmechanismus, Suchworthäufigkeit und Seitentitel einbezogen.

_„Using this scoring approach, Google was able to serve up more accurate results than many of the_ [_existing search engines_](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/071515/search-engines-compete-google.asp) _that preceded it in the market.“_

\- Google konnte durch einen wirtschaftlichen Aufschwung und großer Vertrauen in die Techszene in den 2000er Jahren als Startup schnell Investorengeld einwerben (Dotcom Blase).

Nach dem Ende der Blase wurde von Investoren als garant für ihre Investion ein profitables Geschäftsmodell erwartet. Google entwickelte ein Geschäftsmodell auf der Basis der Online-Plattform Adwords. Durch Adwords führt Google Werbetreibende und Nutzer zusammen. Das Unternehmen kann pro Klick verdienen.

Google erschuf eine Plattform, die relevante Anzeigen für Werbetreibende anbietet.

Adword / Adsense generiert heute automatische Einnahmen für das Unternehmen

\- Das Unternehmen besitzt weitere attraktive Dienste wie YouTube, Maps, Google Apps und Google Cloud. Die Plattformen erreichen größe Nutzergruppen und bieten mehr digitalen Werbeplatz. Auch diese Dienste starteten oft kostenlos und wurden dann iterativ verbessert, sowie durch Werbung monetarisiert.

**Fazit:** Google hat zwei Kernkomponenten. Die eine ist eine Suchmaschine, die von den meisten Menschen auf der Welt bevorzugt wird (Google Suchpage). Die zweite ist ein Selbstbedienungs-Werbenetzwerk, das Einnahmen aus dieser Suchmaschine und den vielen digitalen Assets generiert, die Google besitzt. (AdSense). Mittlerweile erstrecken sich die Dienstleistungen auf Webseiteanalyse (Google Analytics), Navigation (Maps), ein Betriebssystem (Android) welches den Browser (Chrome) mit google als standardsuchmaschine installiert hat, ein Anruf, Kalender, Mail, Office, Cloud-Speicher und AR-Dienst. Kürzlich versuchte es Google auch mit Gaming.

Die Menschen setzen Google ein, um den Zugang zu der massiven Menge an Informationen im Internet zu erhalten und daraus die relevanten auszuwählen. Google übernimmt die Katalogisierung (Crawling), die Auswahl der relevanten Informationen im Kontext einer Suchanfrage (Relevanzabschätzung ?) und die Bereitstellung der Information über die Auslieferung von URLs oder generierten Texten (ab 2021 ?). Dadurch bietet Google als „Interface“ zum Internet den Nutzer einen großen Mehrwert in Form von Zeit und niedrigerem „Mental Load“.

_Source: Gedankenprotokoll_

**Fazit:** Google hat einen Wettbewerbsvorteil, da es möglichst relevante Ergebnisse liefert. Mittlerweile wird die Relevanz durch Algorithmen bestimmt, die basierend auch vorherige Suchergebnisse und einem Nutzerprofil (Siehe Werbe-ID oder Google-Account) die relevantesten Seiten als erstes im Suchfeld anzeigen. Google gewinnt dafür die Daten aus der Interaktion seiner Nutzer mit den diversen Google-Diensten. Zusätzlich binden viele Webentwickler freiwillig das Skript „Google Analytics“ ein, welches Google Webseite übergreifendes Tracking ermöglicht.

Die s. „Dead Internet Theory“ gehen davon aus, dass sich die Seiten aktiver Webseiten durch Google drastisch reduziert haben.

Enrico Tarttori stellt in seinem Video von YouTube „What happened to Google search ?“ fest, dass sich eine fast ausschließliche kommerzielle Platzierung der von google vorgeschlagenen relevantesten Suchergebnisse auf der 1. Seite ergibt.

Kontext der Zitate: Yahoo war voller Links und Bilder und lädt langsam mit 16kb Leitung. Google war leichtgewichtig designt

_„In a nutshell, Google is successful because it creates products that solve problems and create tremendous value for its users._

Products that deliver a great user experience and improve people's lives tend to become habit forming. As a result, Google has become the first choice for for hundreds of millions (even billions for some products) for search, email, maps and many other services that people use daily.From a business perspective, Google has been enormously successful because of its ability to monetize search through AdWords. This has made it possible for Google to create many more successful products and services._“_

_„_No wonder this really made all of those early internet users switch to Google forgetting everything else. So If you ask me what's the single reason behind Google's success - its SIMPLICITY_**“**_

**Fazit:** Google war den Konkurrenten zu seiner Zeit auch technisch überlegen, unter damaligen Voraussetzungen bot es geringere Ladezeiten und ein leichter verständliches UserInterface. Google schaffte es nur das nötigste für seine Aufgabe dem Nutzer anzubieten, die Aufgabe aber außergewöhnlich gut zu erfüllen.

**I.III Google (1998) vs. MSN Search (1999)**

**Context:** In the 90's the big companies AOL, Microsoft and Yahoo competed for market share on 'web portals'. These were news sites often integrated as landing page in their browsers of provided as first redirection of internet providers. They offered a wide range of information to different kind of topics (Sports, TV etc.) and were used as a central spot to publish new digital services to the user. All of them provided human curated content and cooperated with other companies to provide more content. Microsoft made the decision to extend its web portal MSN with a search engine.

* MSN Search was launched in the last quarter of 1998.
* MSN Search didnt had an own index (searchable list) of websites and used results from (human curated) Looksmart and combined with results of Inktomi index based search), and for a short time from AltaVista (index based search).
* Microsoft decided to build its own index, by using a web crawler and published its reworked service with this index as beta in 2004.

**Conclusion:**&#x20;

**I.IV Zeitungen (1650\[1]) vs. Google News (2002)**

\- This article tells the story of advertising revenues at the rise of internet

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/0 (2).png>)- First, it’s important to note that newspaper advertising revenue peaked a few years before the rise of Google (and many years before Facebook).

\- print newspapers had a monopoly on local information distribution due to the prevailing technologies of their time. These regional monopolies were slowly eroded by the introduction, first, of radio and then **television** (see [Lorain Journal Co. v. United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorain\_Journal\_Co.\_v.\_United\_States)). But, ultimately, newspapers were disrupted by the internet (2000er)

![](../../.gitbook/assets/1.png)- newspaper had a monopoly, becuase of high fixed costs (priting press etc) and low scale / margin costs (paper / ink) (→ Technology with high access border)

\- Therefore, it was very easy for newspapers to dominate the local market with one bundled product, which included everything from political news and opinion to sports and classifieds. The monopoly profits were used to fund, among other things, investigative journalism (which would lose money as a standalone business but provides value and prestige as part of a bundle).

\- On pulishing in the internet you dont need printing press / trucks → newspaper was **unbundled** by many internet companies, large and small. Local advertising does googel, commentary can be done on twitter, news on facebook and twitter

\- Google and Facebook entered the ad market with more efficient self-service platforms for advertisers and quickly gained market share. (Decreasing border for advertisers)

\- 2004 to 2014, Google spent at least $23 billion buying 145 companies, facebook 66

\- In other words, Google is not dominant in search today because it engaged in killer acquisitions of rival search engines. Of the 66 Facebook acquisitions, only Instagram is a plausible case of horizontal integration between social media companies (and, even then, Facebook invested heavily post-acquisition).

![](../../.gitbook/assets/2.png)

\- Google and Facbook have no monopoly at advertising revenue in 2016

\- even if we break up all the big tech companies, your local newspaper will not magically have a profitable ad business again.

\- The system changed now newspaper needs new buisness model which cant be secured by protectionism

\- „new media landscape and the growing competition for advertising dollars, make it harder for a weak newspaper to survive, and make its survival less urgent,“

\- Resurrecting the regional monopolies once enjoyed by local newspapers is both undesirable and unrealistic

\- Comment: „There are only a few viable print options now that many have either merged or collapsed. What has followed is a similar result, and the reduced competition and greater need for larger margins means less investigative and less interesting news. There are fewer reasons to consume any of the local „“media options.“

\- Comment: Who has time for print media? This site is a perfect example… it’s focussed on a few topics that I am interested in, I check it fairly regularly. Amazon and Google can help me research something I want to buy, or may someday want to buy, or likely will never buy but am curious about.

The one thing I worry about is **attention span**. By consuming my attention reading single-page items instead of in-depth material, is that affecting how I think in other ways ?

**Fazit:**

\- Der Artikel geht auf den engen Zusammenhang zwischen Werbeeinnahmen, Auflage und Größe von medien ein.

\- Der Autor argumentiert, dass die Zeitungsverleger über die Technologie der Presse und später der Drucker ein Monopol besaßen (hohe Startinvestition und hochskalierbar), dass Ihnen half gebündelte Produkte (Zeitung) zu verschiedenen Themen zu verkaufen und durch die erzeugte Aufmerksamkeit Werbekunden zu bekommen

\- Für den Autor leutete der Technologiewechsel – erst zu Radio später zu Fernsehen, dann zum WWW den Fall dieser lokalen Medienmonopole ein. Laut dem Diagramm „Newspaper Revenue Advertising“ erreichten die Werbeeinnahemn der Zeitungsgesellschaft dort ihren historischen Höhepunkt. Danach wurden sie schnell durch das aufkommende Internet und fortschreitend durch die Dienste von Google und Facebook zurückgedrängt

\- Digitale Dienste, wie Google news sind wetterbewerbsfähiger: Sie senken die Eintrittschwelle, verteilen Informationen gezielter, da sie suchbar sind und das bundel auflösen und verteilen Informationen exterm schnell. Darüber generieren sie mehr Leser als traditionelle Zeitungen.

\- Facebook und Google haben mit dem Aufkauf anderer Firmen den Verdacht auf konkurenzschädigendes Verhalten gemacht. Allerdings korrellieren die Werbeeinanhemn nicht mit der Summe die für den Aufkauf von Konkurrenten ausgegeben bei Google und Facebook. Auch wurden meist fachfremde Firmen aufgekauft.

\- Ein Leser merkt an, dass das auflösen des Bundels und das Ausliefern immer kleinerer Informationshäppchen unser Denken als Gesellschaft kritisch verändern könnte (weniger Gedankenkomplexität)

The articles describes the fall of print media connected with the rise of social media avertisment.

„crisis of the free press and democracy: Advertising revenue that used to go to quality journalism is now captured by big tech intermediaries“

„Advertising revenue for print newspapers has fallen by two-thirds since 2006. From 2008 to 2018, the number of newspaper reporters [dropped 47 percent](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/07/09/u-s-newsroom-employment-has-dropped-by-a-quarter-since-2008/%22%20/t%20%22\_blank). „

„cultural barriers meant to guard against distorting effects of advertising have broken down“

“conflicted communications.: see communication over search engines like Page an Brin saw it.

\- „Richard John [argues](https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674088139%22%20\t%20%22\_blank), for roughly 200 years (beginning with the [creation of the Post Office in 1791](https://www.amazon.com/Spreading-News-American-Postal-Franklin/dp/0674833422%22%20/t%20%22\_blank)), American policymakers generally sought to decentralize media power and keep communication networks neutral.“

\- late 1970s: elaxed antitrust law, eliminated the fairness doctrine

\- „allowed the creation of large media conglomerates through the [Telecommunications Act of 1996](https://www.fcc.gov/general/telecommunications-act-1996%22%20/t%20%22\_blank).“

\- „Google spent at least $23 billion [buying 145 companies](https://www.cnbc.com/2014/08/19/googles-best-and-worst-acquisitions.html%22%20/t%20%22\_blank), including the advertising giant DoubleClick.“

\- „when The Wall Street Journal refused to abide by Google’s formatting terms, Google removed it from its search ranks and the newspaper’s traffic [dropped](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-06-05/wsj-ends-google-users-free-ride-then-fades-in-search-results%22%20/t%20%22\_blank) by 44 percent.“

\- „Google and Facebook grew to control important information utilities, like general search, social networking and mapping. New forms of advertising — underpinned by unregulated use of data and sold through opaque and complex auctions — then undermined the bargaining leverage of publishers and enabled new forms of fraud using bots and falsified content.“

**- „radical centralization of power over the flow of information“**

\- „Advertising financing presents an inherent conflict of interest because advertising is a third party paying to manipulate someone. In traditional media, advertising can influence editorial choices“ (Comment: of Media, it manipulates the search filter)

\- „Consequently, the manifestation of the distorting effect of advertising — addiction, manipulation, fraud, tearing of a collective social fabric — has been met with little cultural immunity, policy response or institutional defenses.“

\- ethical control over advertising: signalling effects of news brands, diversity of new outlets, seperation of advertisment and editorial, groups to protect journalists from company influence

\- „Sergey Brin and Larry Page (Google) — [noted this problem](http://infolab.stanford.edu/\~backrub/google.html%22%20/t%20%22\_blank). They looked at the problematic search engine market of the 1990s — with companies offering advertisers the chance to pay to be listed as an organic search result — and argued that financing a search engine business through advertising was fundamentally corrupting.“ (Comment: But they decided against it, when the dotcom bubble bursted to preserve their company...)

\- Search engines would: „also have an incentive to self-deal, putting content in front of users that benefits the utility rather than the end user. And they would have an incentive to surveil their users, so that they could target them more effectively.“

\- „The task of policymakers is now to put together the ethical structures to mitigate these conflicts.“

\=> Two problems: concentration of power and ethical biased acting of search engines

**Fazit:**

\- Der Artikel erwähnt, dass die großen Zeitungsmonopole in den USA durch den Telecommunications Act 1996 begünstigt wurden, und sich gegen einen dezentralisierten Trend wendeten

\- Google gelang es die Kontrolle über den Infromationsfluss nach 2000 zu gewinnen, sie konnten diese Macht einsetzen um die Arbeit der Zeitungen zu beeinflussen. Für das Walls Street Journal führte eine Weigerung Googles Formatierungsvorschriften einzuhalten zu einem Bescuherminus von 44 %, nach dem die Zeitung nicht mehr bei Google gelistet wurde.

\- Google hat Monopolartige macht über die Informationen im Internet, dieses Monopol ist stärker als die damaligen Mediakonglomerate

\- Mit diesem Monopol treten eine Reihe von Risiken auf:

Internetspezifisch: Verbreitung von Falschanchrichten (jeder kann produzieren) und Bots (jeder kann automatsieren)

Zielkonflikte: Werbefinanziertes Modell, Anzeigen beeinflussen das Verhalten der Nutzer und die Auswahl der gezeigten Medien (Google Suchergebnisse), Journalisten, die Content für Werbung liefern können besser bezahlt werden.

→ Psychologische Effekte: Glaubwürdikeit für Leser könnte sinken (Signaling effect), Breite der angebotenen Artikel könnte sinken (?)

**Kommentar: Was ist mit signaling effects of brands gemeint ?**

**What is the signaling effect of new brands in online newspaper and why is there an debate about it going on ? (Chat-Gpt 3.5 erzeugt am 08.04.2023)**

The signaling effect of new brands in online newspapers refers to the **impact that the presence of new brands has on the perceived quality and credibility of the news website.** In other words, the introduction of a new brand can signal to readers that the website is expanding its coverage and improving the quality of its content.

There is a debate about the signaling effect of new brands in online newspapers because some argue that the presence of multiple brands on a website can dilute the overall credibility of the website, while others argue that it can enhance the website's credibility by signaling growth and diversity in its coverage.

On one hand, those who argue against the use of multiple brands suggest that readers may view the introduction of new brands as a sign that the website is sacrificing quality in order to increase its reach. They suggest that the use of multiple brands can lead to confusion and skepticism among readers about the credibility and consistency of the website's content.

On the other hand, those who argue in favor of using multiple brands suggest that it can signal to readers that the website is expanding its coverage and exploring new areas of interest. They suggest that it can enhance the website's credibility by signaling growth and diversity in its coverage.

Overall, the debate about the signaling effect of new brands in online newspapers highlights the importance of carefully considering the impact that branding decisions can have on the perceived quality and credibility of news websites.

\- „Through both our services and our direct funding of news organizations, Google is one of the world’s biggest financial supporters of journalism.“ „We've shown that commitment over decades of financial support by providing billions of dollars — sharing revenue with news publishers via our ad network, developing tools, training and funding through programs like the Google News Initiative, and launching Google News Showcase.“

\- Googles sees participation to publish on Google News as a free choice. Website oweners can decide if they want to get linked in Google or not and if there are preview snippets are generated about their websites. They can choose between multiple content forms that is displayed as text snippet: no, max char number of snippet, maximum seconfds of a video in a snippet, max image resolution of an snippet, exclude an exact html-div

Since 2019 (?) Gogoles generates text and image snippets as first result, if the websites markup their website with structured data. Google introduced this, because contetn creators argumented google redirecting the traffic to their content to the google website.

\- Google on advertisment revenue in news: „We don’t show ads — or make money — on the vast majority of searches. And we don’t run ads on Google News or the news results tab on Google Search.“

Comment: That true, but most user reach to google news via a clasic google search. At this searches ads are shown.

_- „_Each month, people click through from Google Search and Google News results to publishers' websites [more than 24 billion times](https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/google-news-initiative/setting-record-straight-news/%22%20/t%20%22\_blank).

\- Google on their buisness model: _„_And the internet, while providing cheaper distribution and more potential readers, completely changed the business models of news organizations, with classifieds revenue moving to [specialized online classified services](https://blog.google/around-the-globe/google-asia/australia/de-classified-what-really-happened-newspapers/%22%20/t%20%22\_blank) and increased competition from a wider range of publications._“_

_Google News Initiative:_

\- „The GNI works directly with news organizations of all sizes on developing new products, programs and partnerships to help news publishers grow their business. It includes a $300 million funding commitment to news organizations.“

\- GNI Digital Growth Program:

GNI Workshops: „We’ve provided training for over 400,000 journalists on skills including digital verification, data visualization, and machine learning through in-person trainings. And journalists have visited the GNI Training Center more than 1.7 million times to access free online courses.“ „Topics: Reader Revenue, Audience Development, Advertising Revenue, Data and Product. Our curriculum includes playbooks full of real-world examples, interactive exercises to help solve business problems, workshops to bring these lessons to life and Labs to provide hands-on advisory support“

They provide it as„workshops, playbook, interactive execises with google tools on goal setting, user funnel and scaling, one tone coaching with google labs“

\- GNI Emergency Relif Fund (JERF): Availabel while covid from April 2020. „In the last few months, we have provided $39.5 million in funding to more than 5600 publishers in 115 countries. The money is being applied in diverse and creative ways, from ensuring basic reporting needs and giving emergency stipends to allow reporters to cover the crisis, to driving audience engagement and generating subscriptions.

“

„We learned from publishers that advertising continues to be the sole source of revenue for most JERF recipients, with 50 percent claiming to be totally advertising dependent. A survey we carried out also showed that less than 30 percent of recipients operate some form of a paywall, while less than 18 percent rely on community contributions or memberships to support their journalism. That situation is changing, though, with 60 percent of the recipients planning to diversify their revenue streams by developing subscription, membership or contribution models. “

\- GNI digital tools:

→ Developing of new service like Google Subscription.

_GNI Initiative Innocation Challenge:_

„The [GNI Innovation Challenge](https://newsinitiative.withgoogle.com/info/innovation-challenges/%22%20/t%20%22\_blank) is a global program that empowers news organizations from around the world to demonstrate new thinking in digital journalism. We’re on the lookout for great ideas. Do you want to launch a new news product? Have a never-tested-before approach to increase quality in journalism?

_Subscribe with Google: (GNI)_

![](../../.gitbook/assets/5.png)„[Subscribe with Google](https://newsinitiative.withgoogle.com/subscriptions%22%20/t%20%22\_blank) helps publishers drive new subscribers and engage existing subscribers across the web. Since launching in 2018, this technology has generated over 400,000 new paid subscribers for our news partners. In the last six months alone, partners have grown their subscription base by 100,000.

Publishers control how they deploy Subscribe with Google on their own sites, and keep 85% to 95% of the revenue, while also owning the customer relationship.“

„Like you, we love journalism, but we’re less excited about filling in web forms and clicking on “forgot password” links. So today we’re announcing Subscribe with Google—the simple way to subscribe to news publications and maintain access everywhere: websites, apps, even search results.“

Technologies:

I) Flexible Sampling: Newspapers site decide how many free articles will be shown over google news per user

II) Subscription system: Newspapers can externalize their subscription system to google. To the users there can be offered a subscrition service, where they can subscribe with their google account and pay with google payment

III) Subscription highlights: New articles from their subscribted publishers will be shown in their search results if the topic fits.

Comment: Subscribe with google is the try to introduce the google account as one single account to acces every information.

_Google News Showcase:_

\- „With [Google News Showcase](https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/google-news-initiative/google-news-showcase/%22%20/t%20%22\_blank), we have committed $1 billion over the next three years to pay publishers to produce editorially curated content experiences and for limited free user access to paywalled content.“ „**700+ news publications** have signed onto News Showcase as of June 2021“

\- „News Showcase is made up of story panels that will appear initially in Google News on Android. The product will launch soon on Google News on iOS, and will come to Google Discover and Search in the future. These panels give participating publishers the ability to package the stories that appear within Google’s news products, providing deeper storytelling and more context through features like timelines, bullets and related articles. Other components like video, audio and daily briefings will come next.“

_Audio News:_

„We want to help bridge that gap with new, intelligent audio news experiences that deliver local stories and more personalized content. We’re bringing Your News Update to Google Podcasts and also making it easier to listen to local news when you ask Google Assistant. Both of these updates will feature new natural sounding text-to-speech voices to make the listening experience more enjoyable.&#x20;

Last fall, we [launched](https://www.blog.google/products/news/your-news-update/) our smart audio news playlist Your News Update on Google Assistant. Now, Your News Update is coming to Google Podcasts to make it easier for millions of podcast users in the U.S. to easily discover and listen to the news that’s especially timely and relevant to them.“

„This tailored experience is made possible by applying Google News’s [deep understanding of news stories](https://blog.google/products/news/new-google-news-ai-meets-human-intelligence/) to the audio format and personalizing what you hear. To start, we analyze what’s being said within a given audio file, then apply machine learning techniques to understand how the people, places and things in this story link together and relate to a particular person’s interests. This technology enables us to create playlists of stories that are always up-to-date and customized for everyone who’s using Your News Update. This format helps people hear stories from a variety of local and national publishers all in one place. „

_Google News licencing program:_

\- „Today, we are announcing a licensing program to pay publishers for high-quality content for a new news experience launching later this year. “

\- „Where available, Google will also offer to pay for free access for users to read paywalled articles on a publisher’s site. This will let paywalled publishers grow their audiences and open an opportunity for people to read content they might not ordinarily see. “

_**Fazit:**_

\- Google kontrolliert die Besucherzahlen zu den Portalen der meisten Online Zeitungen. Durch das Zeigen von Ads in seinen Suchergebnisse kann Google Gewinn generieren.

\- Google versucht diesen Gewinn durch Verträge mit Zeitungsgesellschaften zunehmend fair zu verteilen, erhöht allerdings auch die Bindung an seine Produkte.

\- Mit dem GNI Emergency Fund, GNI Initiative Innovation Challenge wird durch Subventionen versucht eine diverse Medienlandschaft zu erhalten.

\- Mit _GNI Digital Growth Program_, werden Verleger in der Nutzung von Googles Digitalen Tools und im Umgang mit Internet news geschult.

\- Mit Technologien, wie Google Subscribtion und News Showcase bietet Google eine Plattform für höherwertigen Content und Abonement modelle an.

Kommentar: Durch Google Subscription und Showcase zieht Google immer mehr die Rollen der ehemaligen Verleger an sich. Die Kundenbindung die sie auf ihren Websiten versucht haben wird von Google obsolet gemacht. Da diese nun nicht nur die Verteilung und die Suche nach Nachrichten kontrollieren, sondern auch den Geldfluss über 2 Kanäle (Ads und Abonnements). Es ist zu vermuten, dass dies Googles Versuch ist die Bestrebung nach neuen Geschäftsmodellen auf sich zu fokusieren.

Google ist in dieser Technologie (Suche und Werbung) Marktführer und die Verleger sind von dieser Technologie insoweit abhängig, dass sie diese Systeme nicht selber umsetzen könnnen. Sie profitieren also auch von dem Abonnementsystem. Allerdings treten die Verleger zunehmend nur als Content Lieferanten auf und zu Googles Systemen gibt es bisher keine ernstzunehmende Konkurrenz.

\- „Australia's decision to make Google and Facebook pay for news has been hailed by many as a triumph for journalism. “ → „just weeks after temporarily blocking [all news content in Australia](https://www.dw.com/en/opinion-australias-big-tech-crackdown-is-no-model-to-emulate/a-56681636), the social media giant turned around and revealed it had agreed to pay dozens of publishers in Germany for content to be featured in "Facebook News," a news showcase that will launch on the platform in Germany in May. “

\- „Similar deals have also been struck in the US and UK. Search engine Google also recently started agreeing to pay publishers for content.“

\- „Antitrust regulators around the globe have been coming down [with increasing force](https://www.dw.com/en/australia-commits-to-media-law-despite-facebook-news-ban-canada-to-follow/a-56621509) on Google and Facebook. They want to make the companies pay publishers for the journalistic content that ends up on these platforms. Until recently, it has been the norm not to pay publishers when links to their content appeared on third-party websites. Google and Facebook are doing these companies a service by exposing them to increased traffic from their users, so the argument from Big Tech goes.“

\- "If content that is relevant for the working of a democratic society is based on diversity," says Wellbrock, "then of course a commercial, algorithmic way of distributing personalized content isn't going to serve the goal of people being exposed to different ideas in the public arena."

\- „"The best thing would be if nobody signed that deal and the publishers, or even regulators, would establish a platform of their own," the professor says.“

\- „Apple offers the subscription-based Apple News+, which gives users access to hundreds of newspapers and magazines. But it doesn't feature all publications, and it only works within the Apple ecosystem.“

\- „"From a journalistic or a democratic perspective, I think we need a solution that makes pretty much all journalistic content available to pretty much everybody," says Wellbrock.“ „. Instead, a log-in through the platform would allow consumers to navigate through the paywalls and onto the websites of all participating providers.“

\- „Criteria for who can use the platform to distribute content could be based on a [set of journalistic standards](https://www.dw.com/en/telling-the-whole-story-the-constructive-journalism-challenge/a-55938994). An algorithm to recommend articles could be developed with an eye toward avoiding filter bubbles. The participating content providers would negotiate the revenue distribution regime.“

\- Such a platform would support: „That's media diversity, because it would give smaller publishers a fair chance to be found on the internet. And secondly, it would make this content broadly accessible."

**Fazit:**

_**-**_ Der Autor sieht die Entwicklung Publisher für die Verlinkungen auf Ihren Content durch Facebook und Google zu bezahlen als Entwicklung von Internetaktivisten und dem Druck von Regierungen.

\- Der Professor Wellbrock merkt an, dass die Plattformen Facebook und Google ein Duopol bei der Werbeeinnahmen und ein Torwächter zu Mediencontent bilden. Diese Konstellation gefährdet aus seiner Sicht den demokratischen Meinungsbildungsprozess: Sie schränken die Diversität an Ideen ein, die im öffentlichen Raum diskutiert werden

\- Er schlägt eine Plattform vor, die aus Kundensicht journalistischen Content zu einer Abogebühr anbietet. Sie soll die Publisher Websiten beim Abruf integrieren und den Nutzer erlauben hinter die Paywall zu navigieren. Aus Publisher Seite sollen die teilnehmenden Publisher (die ihren Content anbieten) laut journalistischen Regeln auf der Plattform zugelassen werden. Durch einen eigenen Algorithmen könnten kleine Publisher gegenüber den großen Chancengleichheit besitzen.

4,7 billion is the purposed number of ad revenue of google in 2008 on engaging user traffic by crawling news websites.

„$4.7 billion is a nice chunk of change, and newspapers think Google should hand some of it over. But immediately, [_people_](https://twitter.com/bgrueskin/status/1138063602521448448) began to [_poke_](https://twitter.com/pilhofer/status/1137934122188443648) at that [_number_](https://twitter.com/Staska/status/1137921368790581249) — in particular, the frankly absurd input on which the whole megillah is based: one stray number mentioned at a lunch in 2008. It’s amazing, honestly.“

Now the article argues that this number is flawed:

„Google mentioned a number in 2008, $100 million. From that one number, you can “extrapolate in a straightforward way” to $4.7 billion today.“

**„you can’t just say 2008 × a multiplier = 2019“ (linear or quadratic interpolation)**

„Google News has no ads, so it generates no direct revenue, but — like all of Google’s products — it serves as one more thing to attract people to the search engine, where the real money is. “

The figure was dropped by Marissa Mayer forom Google: „The online giant figures that Google News funnels readers over to the main Google search engine, where they do searches that do produce ads. And that’s a nice business. Think of Google News as a $100 million search referral machine.“

„Does that mean all ad revenue that comes out of visits driven by Google is ill-gotten too? “News Industry Made $9 Gazillion From Google in 2018, Study Says.“

Author arguments why Google makes money: „Google created consumer products and services — like Google Search — that people find valuable enough to give their attention in very large quantities, all day and night.“ „Google created a much better, much more effective digital ad product than newspapers did or, in their legacy form, ever could.“ „Newspapers used to benefit from people having very few other options for news, information, entertainment, and distraction. People now have a functionally infinite number of options, and they’re not picking newspapers.“

**Fazit:**

_**-**_ Der Autor argumentiert, dass eine Studie die die Werbeinnahmen auf 4,7 Milliarden beziffert keine Grundlage für diese Aussage besitzt. Sie bestehe nur auf einer geschätzten Zahl von 2008 und unfundierter Interpolation

\- Der Autor hebt die Vorteile von Google Traffic für die Zeitungsindustrie hervor. Eine Studie beziffert diese Einnahmen für 2018 auf 9 Millionen (wörtlich: 9 Gazillionen, das könnte ein Witz sein)

\- Der Autor argumentiert Google ermöglicht das Geschäftsmodell im digitalen Zeitalter erst, da Google die Informationen suchbar und attraktiv macht. Eine bessere Werbepalttform bietet als jede Zeitungsgesellschaft und den Nutzern eine höchste Diversität bereistellt.
