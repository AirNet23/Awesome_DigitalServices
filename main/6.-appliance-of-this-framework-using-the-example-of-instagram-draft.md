# 5. Appliance of this framework using the example of „Instagram“ (Draft)

To apply that framework we need to finish chapters I.I to I.II. For the time instagram was created. Then we can start to analyze Instagram in chapter I.III and continuing by referenzing the discoveries of I.I to I.II. My framework is GPT-4 liked, that means we can get our friendly AI to generate a structured text about every service in the world. Please be kind our buddy sometimes forgets a bullet point – you can request it later :)

I did by sending the following prompt to GPT-4.

<mark style="color:blue;">**A:**</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">**I. Past: Roots and consolidation of our digital services (at the time of creation of the service)**</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">**I.I Digital Service promoting properties of human society**</mark>

_<mark style="color:blue;">**I.I.I Properties of communication technology**</mark>_

<mark style="color:blue;">At the time of Instagram's creation in 2010, the landscape of communication technology was rapidly evolving. Smartphones were becoming more prevalent, and mobile internet access was becoming faster and more widely available. This section will delve into the properties of communication technology that contributed to the development and success of Instagram.</mark>

_<mark style="color:blue;">**I.I.I.I Information quality**</mark>_

<mark style="color:blue;">1. High-resolution images: One of the key features that set Instagram apart from other social media platforms at the time was its focus on high-quality images. The rise of smartphones with better cameras allowed users to take and share high-resolution photos easily.</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">2. Filters and editing tools: Instagram introduced filters and editing tools that allowed users to enhance their photos, improving the overall quality of images shared on the platform. This feature helped users create visually appealing content, which was crucial in attracting and retaining users.</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">3. Instant sharing: Instagram allowed users to share their images instantly with their followers, which made the platform more engaging and interactive. This fast-paced sharing of information was a significant aspect of communication technology at the time.</mark>

_<mark style="color:blue;">**I.I.I.II Information availability**</mark>_

<mark style="color:blue;">1. Mobile-first platform: Instagram was designed as a mobile-first platform, which meant that it was primarily accessed through smartphones. This approach made it easier for users to access and share information on the go, capitalizing on the increasing use of mobile devices for internet access.</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">2. Integration with other platforms: Instagram allowed users to share their images on other social media platforms, such as Facebook and Twitter. This integration made it easier for users to share information across multiple platforms, increasing the overall availability of information.</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">3. Discoverability: Instagram introduced features like hashtags and the explore tab, which made it easier for users to discover new content and connect with others who shared their interests. This increased the availability of information on the platform, as users could easily find and engage with content relevant to their interests.</mark>

_<mark style="color:blue;">**I.I.II Properties of Human needs**</mark>_

<mark style="color:blue;">1. Visual communication: Instagram tapped into the human need for visual communication, as images can convey emotions and ideas more effectively than text alone. This focus on visual content resonated with users, who were drawn to the platform's emphasis on aesthetics and creativity.</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">2. Social connection: Instagram provided users with a way to connect with others, both within their existing social circles and with new people who shared their interests. This fulfilled a basic human need for social interaction and connection.</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">3. Self-expression and validation: Instagram allowed users to express themselves through their images and receive validation from others in the form of likes and comments. This met the human need for self-expression and social validation, which are crucial aspects of our mental well-being.</mark>

_<mark style="color:blue;">**I.I.III Properties of human interaction**</mark>_

<mark style="color:blue;">1. Simplicity and ease of use: Instagram's user interface was designed to be simple and intuitive, making it easy for users to interact with the platform and each other. This simplicity encouraged more people to join and engage with the platform, fostering greater human interaction.</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">2. Visual storytelling: Instagram enabled users to share their experiences, interests, and emotions through images and short videos, creating a new form of visual storytelling. This method of communication allowed users to connect with others on a deeper level, as they could share and interpret each other's visual narratives.</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">3. Comments and direct messaging: Instagram provided features like comments and direct messaging, which enabled users to have conversations and interact with each other in real-time. These tools promoted human interaction and helped build a sense of community among users.</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">4. Tagging and mentions: Instagram allowed users to tag other users in their posts and mention them in comments, which facilitated interaction and engagement between users. This made it easy for users to acknowledge others, collaborate on content, or simply share their posts with friends.</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">5. Follower-based model: Instagram's follower-based model encouraged users to engage with others by following their accounts and interacting with their content. This created a sense of connection between users, as they could view and engage with each other's content in their feeds.</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">6. Social validation and feedback: Instagram's like and comment features provided users with immediate feedback on their posts, allowing them to gauge the level of interest and approval from their followers. This social validation encouraged users to continue interacting with the platform and each other, as they sought positive reinforcement from their peers.</mark>

_<mark style="color:blue;">**I.I.IV Properties of our Society System (Capitalism)**</mark>_

<mark style="color:blue;">1. Advertising and monetization: Instagram's visual nature made it an attractive platform for advertisers, who could use the platform to reach a highly engaged audience. This aligned with the capitalist society system, where businesses are driven by profit and the need to reach consumers.</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">2. Influencer culture: Instagram's popularity led to the rise of influencer culture, where users with large followings could monetize their content and partner with brands for sponsored posts. This phenomenon was fueled by the capitalist society system, as influencers sought to capitalize on their popularity and businesses looked to leverage their influence for marketing purposes.</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">3. Competition and innovation: Instagram's success in the social media market led to increased competition among other platforms, driving innovation and improvements in communication technology. This is consistent with the capitalist society system, where competition drives progress and innovation.</mark>
