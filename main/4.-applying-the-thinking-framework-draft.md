**I.I Digital Service promoting properties of human society**

_**I.I.I Properties of communication technology**_

_In this section, we will explore the properties of communication technology that play a crucial role in shaping digital services and their impact on society._

_**I.I.I.I Information quality**_

_This categorization was build on intensive research on communication protocols and data mining. Sadly I can no entagle my thoughts anymore since they also regard from my experience as computer scientist and computer science student._ Information quality refers to the intrinsic value of the information being communicated. It has several dimensions, including:

\- Actuality: The timeliness and relevance of information, which may vary depending on the context and user requirements.

\- Contextuality / user relevance: The degree to which information is tailored or personalized to meet the specific needs or interests of individual users.

\- Diversity: The variety of perspectives, opinions, and sources of information available to users, which can help prevent echo chambers and promote a more balanced understanding of issues.

\- Communicative motivation: The underlying purpose or goal of sharing information, such as economic efficiency for producers and consumers, emotional value, or other factors that drive engagement and interaction.

_**I.I.I.II Information availability**_

_Information availability refers to the accessibility and ease of obtaining information through communication technologies. It encompasses several aspects:_

\- Time independence: The ability to access information regardless of the time of day or time zone, which enables users to engage with digital services at their convenience.

\- Location independence: The ability to access information from any geographical location, provided there is a stable internet connection, making information more widely available and accessible to users.

\- Scalability: The capacity of communication technologies to accommodate increasing amounts of users, information, or data without compromising performance, which includes factors such as hardware costs and the time required to build infrastructure.

_By understanding these properties of communication technology, we can better analyze how digital services have evolved over time and their impact on various aspects of society._

_**I.I.II Properties of Human needs**_

_This section explores the key human needs that digital services cater to, helping us understand why these services have become an integral part of our lives._

\- Connection and belonging: Humans have an inherent need for social connections and a sense of belonging to a community or group. Digital services, such as social networks like Facebook and Instagram, provide platforms for users to connect with others, maintain relationships, and share experiences. These services satisfy our need for social interaction and help us feel more connected to others.

\- Information and knowledge: Our desire for information and knowledge drives us to seek out resources that can enhance our understanding of the world around us. Digital services like search engines (e.g., Google) and knowledge-sharing platforms (e.g., Wikipedia) make it easy for users to access vast amounts of information, catering to our need to stay informed and learn new things.

\- Entertainment and relaxation: People also seek enjoyable experiences and ways to unwind from daily stressors. Digital services like streaming platforms (Netflix, Spotify) and gaming platforms provide various forms of entertainment, satisfying our need for relaxation and enjoyment.

By examining these human needs and how digital services cater to them, we can gain insights into the factors that contribute to the success and widespread adoption of these services in modern society.

_**I.I.III Properties of human interaction**_

_This sections takes in respect that humans can be very emphatically and like to communicate with each other. We as humans possesing a rich variety of spoken, visual, audial and tactiale language to express ourselves. This process creates a unique dynamic that is explored by scientistst and integrated into our digital services. Thesee interaction that play a significant role in the design and success of digital services. Understanding these properties helps us comprehend how digital services facilitate communication and social connections._

<mark style="color:blue;">**Q:**</mark> <mark style="color:blue;"></mark><mark style="color:blue;">\[not documented while writing this text]</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">**A: Social Presence Theory**</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">Social Presence Theory is a theory in communication that explains how different communication technologies influence the sense of "being there" or social presence experienced by individuals during interactions. Digital services like video calling platforms (e.g., Zoom, Skype) and instant messaging apps (e.g., WhatsApp, Messenger) facilitate varying levels of social presence, affecting users' perceptions of closeness and intimacy in their interactions.</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">**Origins:**</mark> <mark style="color:blue;"></mark><mark style="color:blue;">The theory was first proposed by John Short, Ederyn Williams, and Bruce Christie in 1976 as a way to explain how the medium of communication affects the sense of social presence in individuals.</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">**Insights:**</mark> <mark style="color:blue;"></mark><mark style="color:blue;">According to the theory, social presence is the degree to which a communication medium can convey the social cues that are necessary for establishing and maintaining social relationships. This includes factors such as immediacy, intimacy, and interactivity. For example, face-to-face communication is considered to have high social presence because it allows for rich nonverbal cues and real-time feedback, whereas text-based communication may have lower social presence because it lacks these cues.</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">**Implications:**</mark> <mark style="color:blue;"></mark><mark style="color:blue;">The theory has important implications for the design of communication technologies and the way people use them. For example, it suggests that video conferencing may be a better medium for building social relationships than email or chat because it provides more social cues. It also suggests that the use of avatars or other virtual representations of oneself in online environments can enhance social presence.</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">In conclusion, social presence theory highlights the importance of social cues in communication and how different communication technologies can influence the sense of "being there" experienced by individuals. It provides a framework for understanding how different communication media can be used to build social relationships and has implications for the design of technology-mediated communication.</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">**Social Media Richness Theory (SMRT)**</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">Was first introduced by Daft and Lengel in 1986 as an extension of their earlier work on media richness theory. SMRT was developed in the context of the emerging field of computer-mediated communication (CMC), which was rapidly changing the way people communicated and interacted with each other.</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">The theory suggests that the effectiveness of communication depends on the ability of a medium to convey the information sent over it accurately. Rich media, such as video and audio, can transmit more social cues and nuances than text-based communication (e.g. chat rooms), leading to greater understanding and reduced ambiguity. Digital services must balance the richness of the media they offer with the users' preferences and needs for effective communication.</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">**The insights**</mark> <mark style="color:blue;"></mark><mark style="color:blue;">of SMRT are that different types of social media platforms are better suited for different types of communication and interaction. For example, text-based chat rooms may be appropriate for casual social interactions, while video conferencing may be more appropriate for formal business meetings.</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">**The implications**</mark> <mark style="color:blue;"></mark><mark style="color:blue;">of SMRT are that organizations and individuals should choose social media platforms that are appropriate for their communication and interaction goals. SMRT also suggests that social media platforms may be used to supplement face-to-face communication, but they cannot fully replace it due to the richness of in-person communication. Overall, SMRT provides a useful framework for understanding the strengths and limitations of different social media platforms and how they can be used to enhance communication and social interaction.</mark>

**Network effects**

<mark style="color:blue;">**Q:**</mark> <mark style="color:blue;"></mark><mark style="color:blue;">\[not documented while writing this text]</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">**A:**</mark> <mark style="color:blue;"></mark><mark style="color:blue;">Network effects occur when the value of a service increases as more people use it, creating a positive feedback loop that encourages growth. For example, the more people who join a social network, the more valuable it becomes to its users, as they can connect with more people and access more content. Digital services that capitalize on network effects can achieve rapid growth and widespread adoption. Several theories have been developed to explain this effect, including Metcalfe's Law, Reed's Law, and Sarnoff's Law.</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">**Metcalfe's Law**</mark><mark style="color:blue;">, proposed by Robert Metcalfe and Brian Arthur in 1980, states that the value of a network is proportional to the square of the number of its users. This law suggests that the more people use a network, the more valuable it becomes. Metcalfe's Law has been used to explain the success of social media platforms like Facebook and LinkedIn. The implication of this law is that companies can benefit from the network effect by increasing their user base.</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">**Reed's Law,**</mark> <mark style="color:blue;"></mark><mark style="color:blue;">proposed by David P. Reed in 1999, states that the value of a network grows exponentially with the number of subgroups that can form within it. This law suggests that a network's value is not just based on the number of users but also on the potential for subgroups to form. Reed's Law has been used to explain the success of niche social media platforms like LinkedIn Groups and Reddit. The implication of this law is that companies can benefit from the network effect by creating subgroups within their networks that cater to specific interests or demographics.</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">**Sarnoff's Law**</mark><mark style="color:blue;">, proposed by David Sarnoff in the 1920s, states that the value of a network is determined by the number of people who can access it. This law suggests that a network's value is based on its reach rather than its size. Sarnoff's Law has been used to explain the success of broadcast media like television and radio. The implication of this law is that companies can benefit from the network effect by increasing their network's reach, either through expanding their user base or improving their distribution channels.</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">Another influential concept is the</mark> <mark style="color:blue;"></mark><mark style="color:blue;">**"critical mass" theory**</mark><mark style="color:blue;">, which suggests that a network needs a minimum number of users before it becomes valuable to additional users. This idea was introduced by Mark Granovetter in 1978 in his paper "Threshold Models of Collective Behavior."</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">More recently, the work of network scientists such as</mark> <mark style="color:blue;"></mark><mark style="color:blue;">**Duncan Watts and Albert-László Barabási has**</mark> <mark style="color:blue;"></mark><mark style="color:blue;">highlighted the importance of understanding the structure and dynamics of networks in order to fully appreciate network effects.</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">The insights from network effects theory have significant implications for businesses and policymakers. Companies that can create and maintain large networks of users can benefit from significant network effects, including increased user engagement, lower costs, and a competitive advantage. Governments can also use network effects to their advantage by investing in infrastructure that encourages the growth of networks, such as high-speed internet or transportation networks.</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">However, network effects can also lead to the concentration of market power in the hands of a few dominant players, which can make it difficult for new entrants to compete. This has led some policymakers to consider antitrust measures to promote competition in network-based industries. Additionally, network effects can create "lock-in" effects for users, making it difficult for them to switch to alternative networks even if they offer better features or prices.</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">In summary, the network effect is a phenomenon where the value of a product or service increases as more people use it. Metcalfe's Law, Reed's Law, and Sarnoff's Law are three theories that explain different aspects of the network effect, including the relationship between a network's size and its value, the potential for subgroups to form within a network, and the importance of a network's reach. The implications of these laws for companies are that they can benefit from the network effect by increasing their user base, creating subgroups within their networks, and improving their distribution channels.</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">**Q:**</mark> <mark style="color:blue;"></mark><mark style="color:blue;">\[not documented while writing this text]</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">**A:**</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">- Amplification & Self Amplification: Capitalism encourages growth and expansion, leading to amplification effects. Successful digital services often experience rapid growth, with their success further fueling their expansion. This self-amplification can lead to market domination and the formation of digital monopolies.</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">- Market & Market defects: Capitalist markets are built on supply and demand, driving competition and innovation. However, market defects like monopolies, oligopolies, and information asymmetries can create imbalances and inefficiencies in the digital service landscape. Understanding these market dynamics helps us identify areas where intervention or regulation may be necessary to ensure fair competition and consumer protection.</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">- Conglomeration: In a capitalist society, businesses may merge or acquire other companies, forming larger conglomerates that have increased market power and influence. This process can lead to the consolidation of digital services under a few powerful corporations, potentially reducing consumer choice and stifering innovation.</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">- Concurrency: Capitalism drives competition, with businesses constantly seeking to outperform their rivals. In the context of digital services, this competition can lead to rapid innovation and the development of new products and features. However, it can also result in predatory practices, such as price wars or anti-competitive behavior, which can harm consumers and smaller businesses.</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">By examining these properties of capitalism, we can better understand how the capitalist society system influences the development and functioning of digital services, as well as the potential challenges and opportunities that arise within this context.</mark>
